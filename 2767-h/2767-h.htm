    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two men, sole occupants of the somewhat shabby cottage parlour,
      lingered over their port, not so much with the air of wine lovers, but
      rather as human beings and intimates, perfectly content with their
      surroundings and company. Outside, the wind was howling over the marshes,
      and occasional bursts of rain came streaming against the window panes.
      Inside at any rate was comfort, triumphing over varying conditions. The
      cloth upon the plain deal table was of fine linen, the decanter and
      glasses were beautifully cut; there were walnuts and, in a far corner,
      cigars of a well-known brand and cigarettes from a famous tobacconist.
      Beyond that little oasis, however, were all the evidences of a hired
      abode. A hole in the closely drawn curtains was fastened together by a
      safety pin. The horsehair easy-chairs bore disfiguring antimacassars, the
      photographs which adorned the walls were grotesque but typical of village
      ideals, the carpet was threadbare, the closed door secured by a latch
      instead of the usual knob. One side of the room was littered with golf
      clubs, a huge game bag and several boxes of cartridges. Two shotguns lay
      upon the remains of a sofa. It scarcely needed the costume of Miles
      Furley, the host, to demonstrate the fact that this was the temporary
      abode of a visitor to the Blakeney marshes in search of sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furley, broad-shouldered, florid, with tanned skin and grizzled hair, was
      still wearing the high sea boots and jersey of the duck shooter. His
      companion, on the other hand, a tall, slim man, with high forehead, clear
      eyes, stubborn jaw, and straight yet sensitive mouth, wore the ordinary
      dinner clothes of civilisation. The contrast between the two men might
      indeed have afforded some ground for speculation as to the nature of their
      intimacy. Furley, a son of the people, had the air of cultivating, even
      clinging to a certain plebeian strain, never so apparent as when he spoke,
      or in his gestures. He was a Member of Parliament for a Labour
      constituency, a shrewd and valuable exponent of the gospel of the working
      man. What he lacked in the higher qualities of oratory he made up in
      sturdy common sense. The will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp Socialism of the moment, with
      its many attendant &ldquo;isms&rdquo; and theories, received scant favour at his
      hands. He represented the solid element in British Labour politics, and it
      was well known that he had refused a seat in the Cabinet in order to
      preserve an absolute independence. He had a remarkable gift of
      taciturnity, which in a man of his class made for strength, and it was
      concerning him that the Prime Minister had made his famous epigram, that
      Furley was the Labour man whom he feared the most and dreaded the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian Orden, with an exterior more promising in many respects than that
      of his friend, could boast of no similar distinctions. He was the youngest
      son of a particularly fatuous peer resident in the neighbourhood, had
      started life as a barrister, in which profession he had attained a
      moderate success, had enjoyed a brief but not inglorious spell of
      soldiering, from which he had retired slightly lamed for life, and had
      filled up the intervening period in the harmless occupation of censoring.
      His friendship with Furley appeared on the surface too singular to be
      anything else but accidental. Probably no one save the two men themselves
      understood it, and they both possessed the gift of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this peace talk mean?&rdquo; Julian Orden asked, fingering the stem
      of his wineglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Furley grunted. &ldquo;The newspapers must have their daily
      sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a theory that it is being engineered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bolo business, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian Orden moved in his place a little uneasily. His long, nervous
      fingers played with the stick which stood always by the side of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in it, do you?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furley looked straight ahead of him. His eyes seemed caught by the glitter
      of the lamplight upon the cut-glass decanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my opinion of war, Julian,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a filthy, intolerable
      heritage from generations of autocratic government. No democracy ever
      wanted war. Every democracy needs and desires peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; Julian interrupted. &ldquo;You must remember that a democracy
      seldom possesses the imperialistic spirit, and a great empire can scarcely
      survive without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrant nonsense!&rdquo; was the vigorous reply. &ldquo;A great empire, from
      hemisphere to hemisphere, can be kept together a good deal better by
      democratic control. Force is always the arriere pensee of the individual
      and the autocrat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are generalities,&rdquo; Julian declared. &ldquo;I want to know your opinion
      about a peace at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not having any, thanks. You&rsquo;re a dilettante journalist by your own
      confession, Julian, and I am not going to be drawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something in it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; was the careless admission. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a visitor worth having,
      Julian. &lsquo;70 port and homegrown walnuts! A nice little addition to my
      simple fare! Must you go back to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve another batch of visitors coming,&mdash;Stenson amongst them, by
      the bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley nodded. His eyes narrowed, and little lines appeared at their
      corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;What brings Stenson down to Maltenby. I
      should have thought that your governor and he could scarcely spend ten
      minutes together without quarrelling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never do spend ten minutes together alone,&rdquo; Julian replied drily. &ldquo;I
      see to that. Then my mother, you know, has the knack of getting
      interesting people together. The Bishop is coming, amongst others. And,
      Furley, I wanted to ask you&mdash;do you know anything of a young woman&mdash;she
      is half Russian, I believe&mdash;who calls herself Miss Catherine
      Abbeway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know her,&rdquo; was the brief rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lived in Russia for some years, it seems,&rdquo; Julian continued. &ldquo;Her
      mother was Russian&mdash;a great writer on social subjects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway is rather that way herself,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard her
      lecture in the East End. She has got hold of the woman&rsquo;s side of the
      Labour question as well as any one I ever came across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a most remarkably attractive young person,&rdquo; Julian declared
      pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s good-looking. A countess in her own right, they tell me, but
      she keeps her title secret for fear of losing influence with the working
      classes. She did a lot of good down Poplar way. Shouldn&rsquo;t have thought
      she&rsquo;d have been your sort, Julian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian smiled&mdash;rather a peculiar, introspective smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, can, be serious sometimes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend thrust his hands into his trousers pocket and, leaning back in
      his chair, looked steadfastly at his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you can, Julian,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Sometimes I am not quite sure
      that I understand you. That&rsquo;s the worst of a man with the gift for
      silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a great talker yourself,&rdquo; the younger man reminded his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you get me going on my own subject,&rdquo; Furley remarked, &ldquo;I find it
      hard to stop, and you are a wonderful listener. Have you got any views of
      your own? I never hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian drew the box of cigarettes towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve views of my own,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;Some day, perhaps, you
      shall know what they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of mystery!&rdquo; his friend jeered good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian lit his cigarette and watched the smoke curl upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about the duck,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men sat in silence for some minutes. Outside, the storm seemed to
      have increased in violence. Furley rose, threw a log on to the fire and
      resumed his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geese flew high,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too high for me,&rdquo; Julian confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got one more than I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheer luck. The outside bird dipped down to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley filled his guest&rsquo;s glass and then his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth have you kept your shooting kit on for?&rdquo; the latter asked,
      with lazy curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furley glanced down at his incongruous attire and seemed for a moment ill
      at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go out presently,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got to go out?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;On a night like this? Why, my dear fellow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused abruptly. He was a man of quick perceptions, and he realised his
      host&rsquo;s embarrassment. Nevertheless, there was an awkward pause in the
      conversation. Furley rose to his feet and frowned. He fetched a jar of
      tobacco from a shelf and filled his pouch deliberately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to seem mysterious, old chap,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just a bit of a job
      to do. It doesn&rsquo;t amount to anything, but&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s the sort of
      affair we don&rsquo;t talk about much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re welcome to all the amusement you&rsquo;ll get out of it, a night
      like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley laid down his pipe, ready-filled, and drank off his port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much amusement left in the world, is there, just now?&rdquo; he
      remarked gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little indeed. It&rsquo;s three years since I handled a shotgun before
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really chucked the censoring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last week. I&rsquo;ve had a solid year at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fed up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly that. My own work accumulated so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Briefs coming along, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sort of hack journalist as well, as you reminded me just now,&rdquo;
       Julian explained a little evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you stuck at the censoring so long. Isn&rsquo;t it terribly tedious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes. Now and then we come across interesting things, though. For
      instance, I discovered a most original cipher the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it lead to anything?&rdquo; Furley asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present. I discovered it, studying a telegram from Norway. It was
      addressed to a perfectly respectable firm of English timber merchants who
      have an office in the city. This was the original: &lsquo;Fir planks too narrow
      by half.&rsquo; Sounds harmless enough, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. What&rsquo;s the hidden meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I am still at a loss,&rdquo; Julian confessed, &ldquo;but treated with the
      cipher it comes out as &lsquo;Thirty-eight steeple on barn.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley stared for a moment, then he lit his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of the two,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I should prefer the first rendering for
      intelligibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would most people,&rdquo; Julian assented, smiling, &ldquo;yet I am sure there is
      something in it&mdash;some meaning, of course, that needs a context to
      grasp it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you interviewed the firm of timber merchants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not personally. That doesn&rsquo;t come into my department. The name of the man
      who manages the London office, though, is Fenn&mdash;Nicholas Fenn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley withdrew the pipe from his mouth. His eyebrows had come together in
      a slight frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholas Fenn, the Labour M.P.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fellow. You know him, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know him,&rdquo; Furley replied thoughtfully. &ldquo;He is secretary of the
      Timber Trades Union and got in for one of the divisions of Hull last
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that there is nothing whatever against him personally,&rdquo;
       Julian continued, &ldquo;although as a politician he is of course beneath
      contempt. He started life as a village schoolmaster and has worked his way
      up most creditably. He professed to understand the cable as it appeared in
      its original form. All the same, it&rsquo;s very odd that, treated by a cipher
      which I got on the track of a few days previously, this same message
      should work out as I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Furley observed, &ldquo;ciphers can lead you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short. Julian, who had been leaning over towards the cigarette
      bog, glanced around at his friend. There was a frown on Furley&rsquo;s forehead.
      He withdrew his pipe from between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say you made of it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thirty-eight steeple on barn.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-eight! That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it queer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Furley glanced at the little clock upon the
      mantelpiece. It was five and twenty minutes past nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you have ever heard, Julian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that our
      enemies on the other side of the North Sea are supposed to have divided
      the whole of the eastern coast of Great Britain into small, rectangular
      districts, each about a couple of miles square. One of our secret service
      chaps got hold of a map some time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never heard this,&rdquo; Julian acknowledged. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a coincidence, of course,&rdquo; Furley went on, &ldquo;but number
      thirty-eight happens to be the two-mile block of seacoast of which this
      cottage is just about the centre. It stretches to Cley on one side and
      Salthouse on the other, and inland as far as Dutchman&rsquo;s Common. I am not
      suggesting that there is any real connection between your cable and this
      fact, but that you should mention it at this particular moment&mdash;well,
      as I said, it&rsquo;s a coincidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley had risen to his feet. He threw open the door and listened for a
      moment in the passage. When he came back he was carrying some oilskins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know you are a bit of a cynic about espionage and
      that sort of thing. Of course, there has been a terrible lot of
      exaggeration, and heaps of fellows go gassing about secret service jobs,
      all the way up the coast from here to Scotland, who haven&rsquo;t the least idea
      what the thing means. But there is a little bit of it done, and in my
      humble way they find me an occasional job or two down here. I won&rsquo;t say
      that anything ever comes of our efforts&mdash;we&rsquo;re rather like the
      special constables of the secret service&mdash;but just occasionally we
      come across something suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re going out again to-night, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my last night. I am off up to town on Monday and sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be able
      to get down again this season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had any adventures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the ghost of one. I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that I&rsquo;ve had a good many
      wettings and a few scares on that stretch of marshland, but I&rsquo;ve never
      seen or heard anything yet to send in a report about. It just happens,
      though, that to-night there&rsquo;s a special vigilance whip out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Julian enquired curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something supposed to be up,&rdquo; was the dubious reply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a very
      imaginative chief, I might tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what sort of thing could happen?&rdquo; Julian persisted. &ldquo;What are you out
      to prevent, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley relit his pipe, thrust a flask into his pocket, and picked up a
      thick stick from a corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he replied laconically. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an idea, of course, that
      communications are carried on with the enemy from somewhere down this
      coast. Sorry to leave you, old fellow,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit up. I never
      fasten the door here. Remember to look after your fire upstairs, and the
      whisky is on the sideboard here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be all right, thanks,&rdquo; Julian assured his host. &ldquo;No use my
      offering to come with you, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not allowed,&rdquo; was the brief response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heavens!&rdquo; Julian exclaimed piously, as a storm of rain blew in
      through the half-open door. &ldquo;Good night and good luck, old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley&rsquo;s reply was drowned in the roar of wind. Julian secured the door,
      underneath which a little stream of rain was creeping in. Then he returned
      to the sitting room, threw a log upon the fire, and drew one of the
      ancient easy-chairs close up to the blaze.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Julian, notwithstanding his deliberate intention of abandoning himself to
      an hour&rsquo;s complete repose, became, after the first few minutes of
      solitude, conscious of a peculiar and increasing sense of restlessness.
      With the help of a rubber-shod stick which leaned against his chair, he
      rose presently to his feet and moved about the room, revealing a lameness
      which had the appearance of permanency. In the small, white-ceilinged
      apartment his height became more than ever noticeable, also the squareness
      of his shoulders and the lean vigour of his frame. He handled his gun for
      a moment and laid it down; glanced at the card stuck in the cheap looking
      glass, which announced that David Grice let lodgings and conducted
      shooting parties; turned with a shiver from the contemplation of two
      atrocious oleographs, a church calendar pinned upon the wall, and a
      battered map of the neighbourhood, back to the table at which he had been
      seated. He selected a cigarette and lit it. Presently he began to talk to
      himself, a habit which had grown upon him during the latter years of a
      life whose secret had entailed a certain amount of solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I am psychic. Nevertheless, I am convinced that
      something is happening, something not far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a while, listening intently, the cigarette burning away
      between his fingers. Then, stooping a little, he passed out into the
      narrow passage and opened the door into the kitchen behind, from which the
      woman who came to minister to their wants had some time ago departed.
      Everything was in order here and spotlessly neat. He climbed the narrow
      staircase, looked in at Furley&rsquo;s room and his own, and at the third
      apartment, in which had been rigged up a temporary bath. The result was
      unilluminating. He turned and descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either,&rdquo; he went on, with a very slight frown, &ldquo;I am not psychic, or
      whatever may be happening is happening out of doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised the latch of the door, under which a little pool of water was
      now standing, and leaned out. There seemed to be a curious cessation of
      immediate sounds. From somewhere straight ahead of him, on the other side
      of that black velvet curtain of darkness, came the dull booming of the
      wind, tearing across the face of the marshes; and beyond it, beating time
      in a rhythmical sullen roar, the rise and fall of the sea upon the
      shingle. But near at hand, for some reason, there was almost silence. The
      rain had ceased, the gale for a moment had spent itself. The strong, salty
      moisture was doubly refreshing after the closeness of the small, lamplit
      room. Julian lingered there for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like fresh air,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;for driving away fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he suddenly stiffened. He leaned forward into the dark, listening.
      This time there was no mistake. A cry, faint and pitiful though it was,
      reached his ears distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian! Julian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming, old chap,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Wait until I get a torch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped quickly back into the sitting room, drew an electric torch from
      the drawer of the homely little chiffonier and, regardless of regulations,
      stepped once more out into the darkness, now pierced for him by that
      single brilliant ray. The door opened on to a country road filled with
      gleaming puddles. On the other side of the way was a strip of grass,
      sloping downwards; then a broad dyke, across which hung the remains of a
      footbridge. The voice came from the water, fainter now but still eager.
      Julian hurried forward, fell on his knees by the side of the dyke and,
      passing his hands under his friend&rsquo;s shoulders, dragged him out of the
      black, sluggish water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What happened, Miles? Did you slip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bridge gave way when I was half across,&rdquo; was the muttered response.
      &ldquo;I think my leg&rsquo;s broken. I fell in and couldn&rsquo;t get clear&mdash;just
      managed to raise my head out of the water and cling to the rail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold tight,&rdquo; Julian enjoined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to drag you across the road.
      It&rsquo;s the best I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached the threshold of the sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, old chap,&rdquo; faltered Furley&mdash;and fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to himself in front of the sitting-room fire, to find his lips wet
      with brandy and his rescuer leaning over him. His first action was to feel
      his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Julian assured him. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t broken. I&rsquo;ve been over
      it carefully. If you&rsquo;re quite comfortable, I&rsquo;ll step down to the village
      and fetch the medico. It isn&rsquo;t a mile away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about the doctor for a moment,&rdquo; Furley begged. &ldquo;Listen to
      me. Take your torch&mdash;go out and examine that bridge. Come back and
      tell me what&rsquo;s wrong with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the dickens does that matter?&rdquo; Julian objected. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the doctor we
      want. The dyke&rsquo;s flooded, and I expect the supports gave way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as I ask,&rdquo; Furley insisted. &ldquo;I have a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian rose to his feet, walked cautiously to the edge of the dyke, turned
      on his light, and looked downwards. One part of the bridge remained; the
      other was caught in the weeds, a few yards down, and the single plank
      which formed its foundation was sawn through, clean and straight. He gazed
      at it for a moment in astonishment. Then he turned back towards the
      cottage, to receive another shock. About forty yards up the lane, drawn in
      close to a straggling hedge, was a small motor-car, revealed to him by a
      careless swing of his torch. He turned sharply towards it, keeping his
      torch as much concealed as possible. It was empty&mdash;a small coupe of
      pearl-grey&mdash;a powerful two-seater, with deep, cushioned seats and
      luxuriously fitted body. He flashed his torch on to the maker&rsquo;s name and
      returned thoughtfully to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles,&rdquo; he confessed, as he entered the sitting room, &ldquo;there are some
      things I will never make fun of again. Have you a personal enemy here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; replied Furley. &ldquo;The soldiers, who are all decent fellows, the
      old farmer at the back, and your father and mother are the only people
      with whom I have the slightest acquaintance in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bridge has been deliberately sawn through,&rdquo; Julian announced gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furley nodded. He seemed prepared for the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something doing in this section, then,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Julian,
      will you take my job on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a bird,&rdquo; was the prompt response. &ldquo;Tell me exactly what to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley sat up, still nursing his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on your sea boots, and your oilskins over your clothes,&rdquo; he directed.
      &ldquo;You will want your own stick, so take that revolver and an electric
      torch. You can&rsquo;t get across the remains of the bridge, but about fifty
      yards down to the left, as you leave the door, the water&rsquo;s only about a
      foot deep. Walk through it, scramble up the other side, and come back
      again along the edge of the dyke until you come to the place where one
      lands from the broken bridge. Is that clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that, you go perfectly straight along a sort of cart track until
      you come to a gate. When you have passed through it, you must climb a bank
      on your lefthand side and walk along the top. It&rsquo;s a beastly path, and
      there are dykes on either side of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; Julian exclaimed. &ldquo;You forget that I am a native of this part of
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come to a sort of stile at the end of about three hundred yards,&rdquo;
       Furley continued. &ldquo;You get over that, and the bank breaks up into two. You
      keep to the left, and it leads you right down into the marsh. Turn
      seaward. It will be a nasty scramble, but there will only be about fifty
      yards of it. Then you get to a bit of rough ground&mdash;a bank of
      grass-grown sand. Below that there is the shingle and the sea. That is
      where you take up your post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I use my torch,&rdquo; Julian enquired, &ldquo;and what am I to look out for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; replied Furley, &ldquo;except that there&rsquo;s a general suggestion
      of communications between some person on land and some person approaching
      from the sea. I don&rsquo;t mind confessing that I&rsquo;ve done this job, on and off,
      whenever I&rsquo;ve been down here, for a couple of years, and I&rsquo;ve never seen
      or heard a suspicious thing yet. We are never told a word in our
      instructions, either, or given any advice. However, what I should do would
      be to lie flat down on the top of that bank and listen. If you hear
      anything peculiar, then you must use your discretion about the torch. It&rsquo;s
      a nasty job to make over to a pal, Julian, but I know you&rsquo;re keen on
      anything that looks like an adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over it,&rdquo; was the ready reply. &ldquo;What about leaving you alone, though,
      Miles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put the whisky and soda where I can get at it,&rdquo; Furley directed, &ldquo;and
      I shall be all right. I&rsquo;m feeling stronger every moment. I expect your sea
      boots are in the scullery. And hurry up, there&rsquo;s a good fellow. We&rsquo;re
      twenty minutes behind time, as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian started on his adventure without any particular enthusiasm. He
      found the crossing, returned along the side of the bank, trudged along the
      cart track until he arrived at the gate, and climbed up on the dyke
      without misadventure. From here he made his way more cautiously, using his
      stick with his right hand, his torch, with his thumb upon the knob, in his
      left. The lull in the storm seemed to be at an end. Black, low-hanging
      clouds were closing in upon him. Away to the right, where the line of
      marshes was unbroken, the boom of the wind grew louder. A gust very nearly
      blew him down the bank. He was compelled to shelter for a moment on its
      lee side, whilst a scud of snow and sleet passed like an icy whirlwind.
      The roar of the sea was full in his ears now, and though he must still
      have been fully two hundred yards away from it, little ghostly specks of
      white spray were dashed, every now and then, into his face. From here he
      made his way with great care, almost crawling, until he came to the stile.
      In the marshes he was twice in salt water over his knees, but he scrambled
      out until he reached the grass-grown sand bank which Furley had indicated.
      Obeying orders, he lay down and listened intently for any fainter sounds
      mingled with the tumult of nature. After a few minutes, it was astonishing
      how his eyes found themselves able to penetrate the darkness which at
      first had seemed like a black wall. Some distance to the right he could
      make out the outline of a deserted barn, once used as a coast-guard
      station and now only a depository for the storing of life belts. In front
      of him he could trace the bank of shingle and the line of the sea, and
      presently the outline of some dark object, lying just out of reach of the
      breaking waves, attracted his attention. He watched it steadily. For some
      time it was as motionless as the log he presumed it to be. Then, without
      any warning, it hunched itself up and drew a little farther back. There
      was no longer any doubt. It was a human being, lying on its stomach with
      its head turned to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian, who had entered upon his adventure with the supercilious
      incredulity of a staunch unbeliever invited to a spiritualist&rsquo;s seance,
      was conscious for a moment of an absolutely new sensation. A person of
      acute psychological instincts, he found himself analysing that sensation
      almost as soon as it was conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt,&rdquo; he confessed under his breath, &ldquo;that I am afraid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His heart was beating with unaccustomed vigour; he was conscious of an
      acute tingling in all his senses. Then, still lying on his stomach, almost
      holding his breath, he saw the thin line of light from an electric torch
      steal out along the surface of the sea, obviously from the hand of his
      fellow watcher. Almost at that same moment the undefined agitation which
      had assailed him passed. He set his teeth and watched that line of light.
      It moved slowly sideways along the surface of the sea, as though searching
      for something. Julian drew himself cautiously, inch by inch, to the
      extremity of the sand hummock. His brain was working with a new clearness.
      An inspiration flashed in upon him during those few seconds. He knew the
      geography of the place well,&mdash;the corner of the barn, the steeple
      beyond, and the watcher lying in a direct line. His cipher was explained!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfectly cool now, Julian thought with some regret of the revolver which
      he had scorned to bring. He occupied himself, during these seconds of
      watching, by considering with care what his next action was to be. If he
      even set his foot upon the shingle, the watcher below would take alarm,
      and if he once ran away, pursuit was hopeless. The figure, so far as he
      could distinguish it, was more like that of a boy than a man. Julian began
      to calculate coolly the chances of an immediate intervention. Then things
      happened, and for a moment he held his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line of light had shot out once more, and this time it seemed to
      reveal something, something which rose out of the water and which looked
      like nothing so much as a long strip of zinc piping. The watcher at the
      edge of the sea threw down his torch and gripped the end of it, and
      Julian, carried away with excitement, yielded to an instant and
      overpowering temptation. He flashed on his own torch and watched while the
      eager figure seemed by some means to unscrew the top of the coil and drew
      from it a dark, rolled-up packet. Even at that supreme moment, the slim
      figure upon the beach seemed to become conscious of the illumination of
      which he was the centre. He swung round,&mdash;and that was just as far as
      Julian Orden got in his adventure. After a lapse of time, during which he
      seemed to live in a whirl of blackness, where a thousand men were beating
      at a thousand anvils, filling the world with sparks, with the sound of
      every one of their blows reverberating in his ears, he opened his eyes to
      find himself lying on his back, with one leg in a pool of salt water,
      which was being dashed industriously into his face by an unseen hand. By
      his side he was conscious of the presence of a thick-set man in a
      fisherman&rsquo;s costume of brown oilskins and a southwester pulled down as
      though to hide his features, obviously the man who had dealt him the blow.
      Then he heard a very soft, quiet voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will do now. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man by his side grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to make sure of him,&rdquo; he said thickly. Again he heard that
      clear voice from behind, this time a little raised. The words failed to
      reach his brain, but the tone was one of cold and angry dissent, followed
      by an imperative order. Then once more his senses seemed to be leaving
      him. He passed into the world which seemed to consist only of himself and
      a youth in fisherman&rsquo;s oilskins, who was sometimes Furley, sometimes his
      own sister, sometimes the figure of a person who for the last twenty-four
      hours had been continually in his thoughts, who seemed at one moment to be
      sympathising with him and at another to be playing upon his face with a
      garden hose. Then it all faded away, and a sort of numbness crept over
      him. He made a desperate struggle for consciousness. There was something
      cold resting against his cheek. His fingers stole towards it. It was the
      flask, drawn from his own pocket and placed there by some unseen hand, the
      top already unscrewed, and the reviving odour stealing into his nostrils.
      He guided it to his lips with trembling fingers. A pleasant sense of
      warmth crept over him. His head fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he opened his eyes again, he first turned around for the tea by his
      bedside, then stared in front of him, wondering if these things which he
      saw were indeed displayed through an upraised blind. There was the marsh&mdash;a
      picture of still life&mdash;winding belts of sea creeping, serpent-like,
      away from him towards the land, with broad pools, in whose bosom, here and
      there, were flashes of a feeble sunlight. There were the clumps of wild
      lavender he had so often admired, the patches of deep meadow green, and,
      beating the air with their wings as they passed, came a flight of duck
      over his head. Very stiff and dazed, he staggered to his feet. There was
      the village to his right, red-tiled, familiar; the snug farmhouses, with
      their brown fields and belts of trees; the curve of the white road.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a single flash of memory, it all came back to him. He felt
      the top of his head, still sore; looked down at the stretch of shingle,
      empty now of any reminiscences; and finally, leaning heavily on his stick,
      he plodded back to the cottage, noticing, as he drew near, the absence of
      the motor-car from its place of shelter. Miles Furley was seated in his
      armchair, with a cup of tea in his hand and Mrs. West fussing over him, as
      Julian raised the latch and dragged himself into the sitting room. They
      both turned around at his entrance. Furley dropped his teaspoon and Mrs.
      West raised her hands above her head and shrieked. Julian sank into the
      nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melodrama has come to me at last,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Give me some tea&mdash;a
      whole teapotful, Mrs. West&mdash;and get a hot bath ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited until their temporary housekeeper had bustled out of the room.
      Then he concluded his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been sandbagged,&rdquo; he announced impressively, and proceeded to
      relate the night&rsquo;s adventure to his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; declared Julian, about a couple of hours later, as he helped
      himself for the second time to bacon and eggs, &ldquo;is a wonderful tribute to
      the soundness of our constitutions. Miles, it is evident that you and I
      have led righteous lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being sandbagged seems to have given you an appetite,&rdquo; Furley observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a game leg seems to have done the same for you,&rdquo; Julian rejoined.
      &ldquo;Did the doctor ask you how you did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just said that I slipped on the marshes. One doesn&rsquo;t talk of such
      little adventures as you and I experienced last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, what does one do about them?&rdquo; Julian enquired. &ldquo;I feel a
      little dazed about it all, even now living in an unreal atmosphere and
      that sort of thing, you know. It seems to me that we ought to have out the
      bloodhounds and search for an engaging youth and a particularly
      disagreeable bully of a man, both dressed in brown oilskins and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, chuck it!&rdquo; Furley intervened. &ldquo;The intelligence department in charge
      of this bit of coast doesn&rsquo;t do things like that. What you want to
      remember, Julian, is to keep your mouth shut. I shall have a chap over to
      see me this afternoon, and I shall make a report to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; persisted Julian, &ldquo;we&mdash;or rather I&mdash;was without
      a doubt a witness to an act of treason. By some subtle means connected
      with what seemed to be a piece of gas pipe, I have seen communication with
      the enemy established.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that it was the enemy at all,&rdquo; Furley grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For us others,&rdquo; Julian replied, &ldquo;there exists the post office, the
      telegraph office and the telephone. I decline to believe that any
      reasonable person would put out upon the sea in weather like last night&rsquo;s
      for the sake of delivering a letter to any harmless inhabitant of these
      regions. I will have my sensation, you see, Furley. I have suffered&mdash;thank
      heavens mine is a thick skull!&mdash;and I will not be cheated of my
      compensations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, keep your mouth shut, there&rsquo;s a good fellow, until after I have
      made my report to the Intelligence Officer,&rdquo; Furley begged. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here
      about four. You don&rsquo;t mind being about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Julian promised. &ldquo;So long as I am home for dinner, my
      people will be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ll amuse yourself this morning,&rdquo; Furley observed,
      &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m afraid I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be able to get out for the flighting this
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me,&rdquo; Julian begged. &ldquo;Remember that I am practically at
      home. It&rsquo;s only three miles to the Hall from here so you mustn&rsquo;t look upon
      me as an ordinary guest. I am going for a tramp in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky chap!&rdquo; Furley declared enviously. &ldquo;Sunshine like this makes one
      feel as though one were on the Riviera instead of in Norfolk. Shall you
      visit the scene of your adventure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may,&rdquo; Julian answered thoughtfully. &ldquo;The instinct of the sleuthhound is
      beginning to stir in me. There is no telling how far it may lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian started on his tramp about half an hour later. He paused first at a
      bend in the road, about fifty yards down, and stepped up close to the
      hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The instinct of the sleuthhound,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;is all very well,
      but why on earth haven&rsquo;t I told Furley about the car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to consider the matter, conscious only of the fact that each
      time he had opened his lips to mention it, he had felt a marked but
      purposeless disinclination to do so. He consoled himself now with the
      reflection that the information would be more or less valueless until the
      afternoon, and he forthwith proceeded upon the investigation which he had
      planned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was still muddy, and the track of the tyres, which were of
      somewhat peculiar pattern, clearly visible. He followed it along the road
      for a matter of a mile and a half. Then he came to a standstill before a
      plain oak gate and was conscious of a distinct shock. On the top bar of
      the gate was painted in white letters.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                           MALTENBY HALL

                        TRADESMEN&rsquo;S ENTRANCE
</pre>
    <p>
      and it needed only the most cursory examination to establish the fact that
      the car whose track he had been following had turned in here. He held up
      his hand and stopped a luggage trolley which had just turned the bend in
      the avenue. The man pulled up and touched his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you off to, Fellowes?&rdquo; Julian enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Holt station, sir,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;after some luggage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any guests at the Hall who motored here, do you know?&rdquo; Julian
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the young lady, sir,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;Miss Abbeway. She came in a
      little coupe Panhard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian frowned thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she been out in it this morning?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She broke down in it yesterday afternoon, sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;about
      halfway up to the Hall here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broke down?&rdquo; Julian repeated. &ldquo;Anything serious? Couldn&rsquo;t you put it
      right for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t let me touch it, sir,&rdquo; the man explained. &ldquo;She said she had
      two cracked sparking plugs, and she wanted to replace them herself. She
      has had some lessons, and I think she wanted a bit of practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Then the car is in the avenue now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About half a mile up, on the left-hand side, sir, just by the big elm.
      Miss Abbeway said she was coming down this afternoon to put new plugs in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s been there all the time since yesterday afternoon?&rdquo; Julian
      persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady wished it left there, sir. I could have put a couple of
      plugs in, in five minutes, and brought her up to the house, but she
      wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Fellowes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any luck with the geese last night, sir?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;I heard there
      was a pack of them on Stiffkey Marshes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got one. They came badly for us,&rdquo; Julian replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way up the avenue. At exactly the spot indicated by the
      chauffeur a little coupe car was standing, drawn on to the turf. He
      glanced at the name of the maker and looked once more at the tracks upon
      the drive. Finally, he decided that his investigations were leading him in
      a most undesirable direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned back, walked across the marshes, where he found nothing to
      disturb him, and lunched with Furley, whose leg was now so much better
      that he was able to put it to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about this visitor of yours?&rdquo; Julian asked, as they sat smoking
      afterwards. &ldquo;I must be back at the Hall in time to dine to-night, you
      know. My people made rather a point of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, he isn&rsquo;t coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not coming?&rdquo; Julian repeated. &ldquo;Jove, I should have thought you&rsquo;d have had
      intelligence officers by the dozen down here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some reason or other,&rdquo; Furley confided, &ldquo;the affair has been handed
      over to the military authorities. I have had a man down to see me this
      morning, and he has taken full particulars. I don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;ll even
      worry you at all&mdash;until later on, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove, that seems queer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night&rsquo;s happening was queer, for that matter,&rdquo; Furley continued.
      &ldquo;Their only chance, I suppose, of getting to the bottom of it is to lie
      doggo as far as possible. It isn&rsquo;t like a police affair, you see. They
      don&rsquo;t want witnesses and a court of justice. One man&rsquo;s word and a rifle
      barrel does the trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that if I do my duty as a loyal subject, I
      shall drop the curtain on last night. Seems a pity to have had an
      adventure like that and not be able to open one&rsquo;s mouth about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to join the noble army of gas bags,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Much better
      make up your mind that it was a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are times,&rdquo; Julian confided, &ldquo;when I am not quite sure that it
      wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Julian entered the drawing-room at Maltenby Hall a few minutes before
      dinner time that evening. His mother, who was alone and, for a wonder,
      resting, held out her hand for him to kiss and welcomed him with a
      charming smile. Notwithstanding her grey hair, she was still a remarkably
      young-looking woman, with a great reputation as a hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Julian,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you look like a ghost! Don&rsquo;t tell me
      that you had to sit up all night to shoot those wretched duck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian drew a chair to his mother&rsquo;s side and seated himself with a little
      air of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never have I been more conscious of the inroads of age,&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;I
      can remember when, ten or fifteen years ago, I used to steal out of the
      house in the darkness and bicycle down to the marsh with a twenty-bore
      gun, on the chance of an odd shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; his mother went on, &ldquo;after spending half the night wading
      about in the salt water, you spent the other half talking to that terrible
      Mr. Furley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. We got cold and wet through in the evening; we sat up
      talking till the small hours; we got cold and wet again this morning&mdash;and
      here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A converted sportsman,&rdquo; his mother observed. &ldquo;I wish you could convert
      your friend, Mr. Furley. There&rsquo;s a perfectly terrible article of his in
      the National this month. I can&rsquo;t understand a word of it, but it reads
      like sheer anarchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as the world exists,&rdquo; Julian remarked, &ldquo;there must be Socialists,
      and Furley is at least honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Julian,&rdquo; his mother protested, &ldquo;how can a Socialist be honest!
      Their attitude with regard to the war, too, is simply disgraceful. I am
      sure that in any other country that man Fenn, for instance, would be
      shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about your house party?&rdquo; Julian enquired, with bland irrelevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All arrived. I suppose they&rsquo;ll be down directly. Mr. Hannaway Wells is
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Wells!&rdquo; Julian murmured. &ldquo;How does he look since he became a
      Cabinet Minister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Portentous,&rdquo; Lady Maltenby replied; with a smile. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look as
      though he would ever unbend. Then the Shervintons are here, and the
      Princess Torski&mdash;your friend Miss Abbeway&rsquo;s aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Princess Torski?&rdquo; Julian repeated. &ldquo;Who on earth is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was English,&rdquo; his mother explained, &ldquo;a cousin of the Abbeways. She
      married in Russia and is on her way now to France to meet her husband, who
      is in command of a Russian battalion there. She seems quite a pleasant
      person, but not in the least like her niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway is still here, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. I asked her for a week, and I think she means to stay. We
      talked for an hour after tea this afternoon, and I found her most
      interesting. She has been living in England for years, it seems, down in
      Chelsea, studying sculpture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a remarkably clever young woman,&rdquo; Julian said thoughtfully, &ldquo;but a
      little incomprehensible. If the Princess Torski is her aunt, who were her
      parents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father,&rdquo; the Countess replied, &ldquo;was Colonel Richard Abbeway, who
      seems to have been military attache at St. Petersburg, years ago. He
      married a sister of the Princess Torski&rsquo;s husband, and from her this young
      woman inherited a title which she won&rsquo;t use and a large fortune. Colonel
      Abbeway was killed accidentally in the Russo-Japanese War, and her mother
      died a few years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No German blood, or anything of that sort, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, what an idea!&rdquo; his mother exclaimed reprovingly. &ldquo;On the
      contrary, the Torskis are one of the most aristocratic families in Russia,
      and you know what the Abbeways are. The girl is excellently bred, and I
      think her charming in every way. Whatever made you suggest that she might
      have German blood in her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea! Anyhow, I am glad she hasn&rsquo;t. Who else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bishop,&rdquo; his mother continued, &ldquo;looking very tired, poor dear! Doctor
      George Lennard, from Oxford, two young soldiers from Norwich, whom Charlie
      asked us to be civil to&mdash;and the great man himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about the great man? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen him to speak to
      since he became Prime Minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He declares that this is his first holiday this year. He is looking
      rather tired, but he has had an hour&rsquo;s shooting since he arrived, and
      seemed to enjoy it. Here&rsquo;s your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Maltenby, who entered a moment later, was depressingly
      typical. He was as tall as his youngest son, with whom he shook hands
      absently and whom he resembled in no other way. He had the conventionally
      aristocratic features, thin lips and steely blue eyes. He was apparently a
      little annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything wrong, dear?&rdquo; Lady Maltenby asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband took up his position on the hearthrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am annoyed with Stenson,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad of you, Henry,&rdquo; she expostulated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been trying to
      talk politics with him. You know that the poor man was only longing for
      forty-eight hours during which he could forget that he was Prime Minister
      of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, my dear,&rdquo; Lord Maltenby agreed. &ldquo;I can assure you that I have
      not transgressed in any way. A remark escaped me referring to the
      impossibility of providing beaters, nowadays, and to the fact that out of
      my seven keepers, five are fighting. I consider Mr. Stenson&rsquo;s comment was
      most improper, coming from one to whom the destinies of this country are
      confided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; the Countess asked meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something about wondering whether any man would be allowed to have seven
      keepers after the war,&rdquo; her husband replied, with an angry light in his
      eyes. &ldquo;If a man like Stenson is going to encourage these socialistic
      ideas. I beg your pardon&mdash;the Bishop, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remaining guests drifted in within the next few moments,&mdash;the
      Bishop, Julian&rsquo;s godfather, a curious blend of the fashionable and the
      devout, the anchorite and the man of the people; Lord and Lady Shervinton,
      elderly connections of the nondescript variety; Mr. Hannaway Wells,
      reserved yet, urbane, a wonderful type of the supreme success of
      mediocrity; a couple of young soldiers, light-hearted and out for a good
      time, of whom Julian took charge; an Oxford don, who had once been Lord
      Maltenby&rsquo;s tutor; and last of all the homely, very pleasant-looking,
      middle-aged lady, Princess Torski, followed by her niece. There were a few
      introductions still to be effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Lady Maltenby was engaged in this task, which she performed at all
      times with the unfailing tact of a great hostess, Julian broke off in his
      conversation with the two soldiers and looked steadfastly across the room
      at Catherine Abbeway, as though anxious to revise or complete his earlier
      impressions of her. She was of medium height, not unreasonably slim, with
      a deliberate but noticeably graceful carriage. Her complexion was inclined
      to be pale. She had large, soft brown eyes, and hair of an unusual shade
      of chestnut brown, arranged with remarkably effective simplicity. She wore
      a long string of green beads around her neck, a black tulle gown without
      any relief of colour, but a little daring in its cut. Her voice and laugh,
      as she stood talking to the Bishop, were delightful, and neither her
      gestures nor her accent betrayed the slightest trace of foreign blood. She
      was, without a doubt, extraordinarily attractive, gracious almost to
      freedom in her manner, and yet with that peculiar quality of aloofness
      only recognisable in the elect,&mdash;a very appreciable charm. Julian
      found his undoubted admiration only increased by his closer scrutiny.
      Nevertheless, as he watched her, there was a slightly puzzled frown upon
      his forehead, a sense of something like bewilderment mingled with those
      other feelings. His mother, who had turned to speak to the object of his
      attentions, beckoned him, and he crossed the room at once to their side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian is going to take you in to dinner, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; the Countess
      announced, &ldquo;and I hope you will be kind to him, for he&rsquo;s been out all
      night and a good part of the morning, too, shooting ducks and talking
      nonsense with a terrible Socialist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Maltenby passed on. Julian, leaning on his stick, looked down with a
      new interest into the face which had seldom been out of his thoughts since
      their first meeting, a few weeks ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Mr. Orden,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;which did you find the more exhausting&mdash;tramping
      the marshes for sport, or discussing sociology with your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t tramp the marshes. We stood
      still and got uncommonly wet. And I shot a goose, which made me very
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must have been the conversation,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Is your friend a
      prophet or only one of the multitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prophet, most decidedly. He is a Mr. Miles Furley, of whom you must
      have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles Furley!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I had no idea that he lived in this part of
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a small country house somewhere in Norfolk,&rdquo; Julian told her, &ldquo;and
      he takes a cottage down here at odd times for the wild-fowl shooting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take me to see him to-morrow?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, so long as you promise not to talk socialism with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will promise that readily, out of consideration to my escort. I wonder
      how it is,&rdquo; she went on, looking up at him a little thoughtfully, &ldquo;that
      you dislike serious subjects so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A frivolous turn of mind, I suppose,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I certainly prefer to
      talk art with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nowadays,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;it is altogether the fashion down at
      Chelsea to discard art and talk politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fashion I shouldn&rsquo;t follow,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;I should stick to art,
      if I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that depends upon how you define politics, of course. I don&rsquo;t mean
      Party politics. I mean the science of living, as a whole, not as a unit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess ambled up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your political views are, Mr. Orden,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
      you must look out for shocks if you discuss social questions with my
      niece. In the old days they would never have allowed her to live in
      Russia. Even now, I consider some of her doctrines the most pernicious I
      ever heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that terrible from an affectionate aunt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine laughed, as the Princess passed on. &ldquo;Tell me some more about
      your adventures last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up into his face, and Julian was suddenly conscious from whence
      had come that faint sense of mysterious trouble which had been with him
      during the last few minutes. The slight quiver of her lips brought it all
      back to him. Her mouth, beyond a doubt, with its half tender, half mocking
      curve, was the mouth which he had seen in that tangled dream of his, when
      he had lain fighting for consciousness upon the marshes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Julian, absorbed for the first few minutes of dinner by the
      crystallisation of this new idea which had now taken a definite place in
      his brain, found his conversational powers somewhat at a discount.
      Catherine very soon, however, asserted her claim upon his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do your duty and tell me about things,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Remember that
      I am Cinderella from Bohemia, and I scarcely know a soul here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there aren&rsquo;t many to find out about, are there?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Of
      course you know Stenson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been gazing at him with dilated eyes,&rdquo; she confided. &ldquo;Is that not
      the proper thing to do? He seems to me very ordinary and very hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, there is the Bishop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him at once from his photographs. He must spend the whole of the
      time when he isn&rsquo;t in church visiting the photographer. However, I like
      him. He is talking to my aunt quite amiably. Nothing does aunt so much
      good as to sit next a bishop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Shervintons you know all about, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The soldiers
      are just young men from the Norwich barracks, Doctor Lennard was my
      father&rsquo;s tutor at Oxford, and Mr. Hannaway Wells is our latest Cabinet
      Minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He still has the novice&rsquo;s smirk,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;A moment ago I heard him
      tell his neighbour that he preferred not to discuss the war. He probably
      thinks that there is a spy under the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there we are&mdash;such as we are,&rdquo; Julian concluded. &ldquo;There is no
      one left except me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me all about yourself,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Really, when I come to
      think of it, considering the length of our conversations, you have been
      remarkably reticent. You are the youngest of the family, are you not? How
      many brothers are there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were four,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Henry was killed at Ypres last year. Guy
      is out there still. Richard is a Brigadier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a barrister by profession, but I went out with the first Inns of
      Court lot for a little amateur soldiering and lost part of my foot at
      Mons. Since then I have been indulging in the unremunerative and highly
      monotonous occupation of censoring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monotonous indeed, I should imagine,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;You spend your time
      reading other people&rsquo;s letters, do you not, just to be sure that there are
      no communications from the enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;We discover ciphers and all sorts of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brainy people you must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are, most of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you do anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve given up censoring for the present,&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;I am going
      back to my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a barrister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. I might add that I do a little hack journalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How modest!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I suppose you write the leading articles for
      the Times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a very young lady,&rdquo; Julian observed impressively, &ldquo;you have
      marvellous insight. How did you guess my secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am better at guessing secrets than you are,&rdquo; she retorted a little
      insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for some moments. The faint curve of her lips had again
      given him almost a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a brother?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I met some one quite lately&mdash;within the last few hours, as a
      matter of fact&mdash;with a mouth exactly like yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a horrible thing!&rdquo; she exclaimed, drawing out a little mirror
      from the bag by her side and gazing into it. &ldquo;How unpleasant to have any
      one else going about with a mouth exactly like one&rsquo;s own! No, I never had
      a brother, Mr. Orden, or a sister, and, as you may have heard, I am an
      enfant mechante. I live in London, I model very well, and I talk very bad
      sociology. As I think I told you, I know your anarchist friend, Miles
      Furley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t call Furley an anarchist,&rdquo; protested Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is a Socialist. I admit that we are rather lax in our
      definitions. You see, there is just one subject, of late years, which has
      brought together the Socialists and the Labour men, the Syndicalists and
      the Communists, the Nationalists and the Internationalists. All those who
      work for freedom are learning breadth. If they ever find a leader, I think
      that this dear, smug country of yours may have to face the greatest
      surprise of its existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian looked at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have ideas, Miss Abbeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So unusual in a woman!&rdquo; she mocked. &ldquo;Do you notice how every one is
      trying to avoid the subject of the war? I give them another half-course,
      don&rsquo;t you? I am sure they cannot keep it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t go the distance,&rdquo; Julian whispered. &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question to be considered,&rdquo; Lord Shervinton pronounced, &ldquo;is not so
      much when the war will be over as what there is to stop it? That is a
      point which I think we can discuss without inviting official
      indiscretions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If other means fail,&rdquo; declared the Bishop, &ldquo;Christianity will stop it.
      The conscience of the world is already being stirred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our enemies,&rdquo; the Earl pronounced confidently from his place at the head
      of the table, &ldquo;are already a broken race. They are on the point of
      exhaustion. Austria is, if possible, in a worse plight. That is what will
      end the war&mdash;the exhaustion of our opponents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deciding factor,&rdquo; Mr. Hannaway Wells put in, with a very
      non-committal air, &ldquo;will probably be America. She will bring her full
      strength into the struggle just at the crucial moment. She will probably
      do what we farther north have as yet failed to do: she will pierce the
      line and place the German armies in Flanders in peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cabinet Minister&rsquo;s views were popular. There was a little murmur of
      approval, something which sounded almost like a purr of content. It was
      just one more expression of that strangely discreditable yet almost
      universal failing,&mdash;the over-reliance upon others. The quiet remark
      of the man who suddenly saw fit to join in the discussion struck a
      chilling and a disturbing note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing which could end the war at any moment,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson
      said, leaning a little forward, &ldquo;and that is the will of the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was perplexity as well as discomfiture in the minds of his hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people?&rdquo; Lord Shervinton repeated. &ldquo;But surely the people speak
      through the mouths of their rulers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been content to, up to the present,&rdquo; the Prime Minister agreed,
      &ldquo;but Europe may still see strange and dramatic events before many years
      are out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go on, please,&rdquo; the Countess begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stenson shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even as a private individual I have said more than I intended,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;I have only one thing to say about the war in public, and that
      is that we are winning, that we must win, that our national existence
      depends upon winning, and that we shall go on until we do win. The
      obstacles between us and victory, which may remain in our minds, are not
      to be spoken of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief and somewhat uncomfortable pause. It was understood that
      the subject was to be abandoned. Julian addressed a question to the Bishop
      across the table. Lord Maltenby consulted Doctor Lennard as to the date of
      the first Punic War. Mr. Stenson admired the flowers. Catherine, who had
      been sitting with her eyes riveted upon the Prime Minister, turned to her
      neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about your amateur journalism, Mr. Orden?&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I have an
      idea that it ought to be interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deadly dull, I can assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You write about politics? Or perhaps you are an art critic? I ought to be
      on my best behaviour, in case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know little about art,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;My chief interest in life&mdash;outside
      my profession, of course&mdash;lies in sociology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His little confession had been impulsive. She raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in earnest, I believe!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Have I really found an
      Englishman who is in earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I plead guilty. It is incorrect philosophy but a distinct stimulus to
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;that you are so handicapped by birth!
      Sociology cannot mean anything very serious for you. Your perspective is
      naturally distorted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about yourself?&rdquo; he asked pertinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vanity of us women!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I have grown to look upon myself
      as being an exception. I forget that there might be others. You might even
      be one of our prophets&mdash;a Paul Fiske in disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes narrowed a little as he looked at her closely. From across the
      table, the Bishop broke off an interesting discussion on the subject of
      his addresses to the working classes, and the Earl set down his wineglass
      with an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does no one really know,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson asked, &ldquo;who Paul Fiske is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Hannaway Wells replied. &ldquo;I thought it wise, a short
      time ago, to set on foot the most searching enquiries, but they were
      absolutely fruitless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must plead guilty,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;to having visited the offices of The
      Monthly Review with the same object. I left a note for him there, in
      charge of the editor, inviting him to a conference at my house. I received
      no reply. His anonymity seems to be impregnable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever he may be,&rdquo; the Earl declared, &ldquo;he ought to be muzzled. He is a
      traitor to his country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot agree with you, Lord Maltenby,&rdquo; the Bishop said firmly. &ldquo;The
      very danger of the man&rsquo;s doctrines lies in their clarity of thought, their
      extraordinary proximity to the fundamental truths of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is, at any rate,&rdquo; Doctor Lennard interposed, &ldquo;the most brilliant
      anonymous writer since the days of Swift and the letters of Junius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stenson for a moment hesitated. He seemed uncertain whether or no to
      join in the conversation. Finally, impulse swayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us all be thankful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Paul Fiske is content with the
      written word. If the democracy of England found themselves to-day with
      such a leader, it is he who would be ruling the country, and not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is a pacifist!&rdquo; the Earl protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we all are,&rdquo; the Bishop declared warmly. &ldquo;We are all pacifists in the
      sense that we are lovers of peace. There is not one of us who does not
      deplore the horrors of to-day. There is not one of us who is not
      passionately seeking for the master mind which can lead us out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one way out,&rdquo; the Earl insisted, &ldquo;and that is to beat the
      enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the only obvious way,&rdquo; Julian intervened, joining in the
      conversation for the first time, &ldquo;but meanwhile, with every tick of the
      clock a fellow creature dies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a question,&rdquo; Mr. Hannaway Wells reflected, &ldquo;whether the present
      generation is not inclined to be mawkish with regard to human life.
      History has shown us the marvellous benefits which have accrued to the
      greatest nations through the lessening of population by means of warfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;History has also shown us,&rdquo; Doctor Lennard observed, &ldquo;that the last
      resource of force is force. No brain has ever yet devised a logical scheme
      for international arbitration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human nature, I am afraid, has changed extraordinarily little since the
      days of the Philistines,&rdquo; the Bishop confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian turned to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve all settled it amongst themselves, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;Here you may sit and listen to what may be called the modern
      voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet there is one thing wanting,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;What do you suppose, if
      he were here at this moment, Paul Fiske would say? Do you think that he
      would be content to listen to these brazen voices and accept their
      verdict?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without irreverence,&rdquo; Julian answered, &ldquo;or comparison, would Jesus
      Christ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the same proviso,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;I might reply that Jesus Christ,
      from all we know of him, might reign wonderfully in the Kingdom of Heaven,
      but he certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep together a Cabinet in Downing
      Street! Still, I am beginning to believe in your sincerity. Do you think
      that Paul Fiske is sincere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; Julian replied, &ldquo;that he sees the truth and struggles to
      express it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women were leaving the table. She leaned towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not be long,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You must admit that I have been
      an admirable dinner companion. I have talked to you all the time on your
      own subject. You must come and talk to me presently about art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian, with his hand on the back of his chair, watched the women pass out
      of the soft halo of the electric lights into the gloomier shadows of the
      high, vaulted room, Catherine a little slimmer than most of the others,
      and with a strange grace of slow movement which must have come to her from
      some Russian ancestor. Her last words lingered in his mind. He was to talk
      to her about art! A fleeting vision of the youth in the yellow oilskins
      mocked him. He remembered his morning&rsquo;s tramp and the broken-down
      motor-car under the trees. The significance of these things was beginning
      to take shape in his mind. He resumed his seat, a little dazed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Maltenby was one of those old-fashioned houses where the port is served as
      a lay sacrament and the call of the drawing-room is responded to tardily.
      After the departure of the women, Doctor Lennard drew his chair up to
      Julian&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An interesting face, your dinner companion&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;They tell me
      that she is a very brilliant young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She certainly has gifts,&rdquo; acknowledged Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I watched her whilst she was talking to you,&rdquo; the Oxford don continued.
      &ldquo;She is one of those rare young women whose undoubted beauty is put into
      the background by their general attractiveness. Lady Maltenby was telling
      me fragments of her history. It appears that she is thinking of giving up
      her artistic career for some sort of sociological work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is curious,&rdquo; Julian reflected, &ldquo;how the cause of the people has always
      appealed to gifted Russians. England, for instance, produces no real
      democrats of genius. Russia seems to claim a monopoly of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing so stimulating as a sense of injustice for bringing the
      best out of a man or woman,&rdquo; Doctor Lennard pointed out. &ldquo;Russia, of
      course, for many years has been shamefully misgoverned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation, owing to the intervention of other of the guests, became
      general and platitudinal. Soon after, Mr. Stenson rose and excused
      himself. His secretary; who had been at the telephone, desired a short
      conference. There was a brief silence after his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stenson,&rdquo; the Oxonian observed, &ldquo;is beginning to show signs of strain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Lord Shervinton pointed out. &ldquo;He came into office full of the
      most wonderful enthusiasm. His speeches rang through the world like a
      clarion note. He converted waverers. He lit fires which still burn. But he
      is a man of movement. This present stagnation is terribly irksome to him.
      I heard him speak last week, and I was disappointed. He seems to have lost
      his inspiration. What he needs is a stimulus of some sort, even of
      disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; the Bishop reflected, &ldquo;if he is really afraid of the people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider his remark concerning them most ill-advised,&rdquo; Lord Maltenby
      declared pompously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the people,&rdquo; the Bishop continued, &ldquo;and I love them. I think, too,
      that they trust me. Yet I am not sure that I cannot see a glimmering of
      what is at the back of Stenson&rsquo;s mind. There are a good many millions in
      the country who honestly believe that war is primarily an affair of the
      politicians; who believe, too, that victory means a great deal more to
      what they term &lsquo;the upper classes&rsquo; than it does to them. Yet, in every
      sense of the word, they are bearing an equal portion of the fight,
      because, when it comes down to human life, the life of the farm labourer&rsquo;s
      son is of the same intrinsic value as the life of the peer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Maltenby moved a little in his chair. There was a slight frown upon
      his aristocratic forehead. He disagreed entirely with the speaker, with
      whom he feared, however, to cross swords. Mr. Hannaway Wells, who had been
      waiting for his opportunity, took charge of the conversation. He spoke in
      a reserved manner, his fingers playing with the stem of his wineglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I feel the deepest interest in what the
      Bishop has just said. I could not talk to you about the military
      situation, even if I knew more than you do, which is not the case, but I
      think it is clear that we have reached something like a temporary impasse.
      There certainly seems to be no cause for alarm upon any front, yet, not
      only in London, but in Paris and even Rome, there is a curious uneasiness
      afoot, for which no one can account which no one can bring home to any
      definite cause. In the same connection, we have confidential information
      that a new spirit of hopefulness is abroad in Germany. It has been
      reported to us that sober, clear-thinking men&mdash;and there are a few of
      them, even in Germany&mdash;have predicted peace before a month is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The assumption is,&rdquo; Doctor Lennard interpolated, &ldquo;that Germany has
      something up her sleeve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not only the assumption,&rdquo; the Cabinet Minister replied, &ldquo;but it
      is also, I believe, the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One could apprehend and fear a great possible danger,&rdquo; Lord Shervinton
      observed, &ldquo;if the Labour Party in Germany were as strong as ours, or if
      our own Labour Party were entirely united. The present conditions,
      however, seem to me to give no cause for alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where I think you are wrong,&rdquo; Hannaway Wells declared. &ldquo;If the
      Labour Party in Germany were as strong as ours, they would be strong
      enough to overthrow the Hohenzollern clique, to stamp out the militarism
      against which we are at war, to lay the foundations of a great German
      republic with whom we could make the sort of peace for which every
      Englishman hopes. The danger, the real danger which we have to face, would
      lie in an amalgamation of the Labour Party, the Socialists and the
      Syndicalists in this country, and in their insisting upon treating with
      the weak Labour Party in Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with the Bishop,&rdquo; Julian pronounced. &ldquo;The unclassified democracy
      of our country may believe itself hardly treated, but individually it is
      intensely patriotic. I do not believe that its leaders would force the
      hand of the country towards peace, unless they received full assurance
      that their confreres in Germany were able to assume a dominant place in
      the government of that country&mdash;a place at least equal to the
      influence of the democracy here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Lennard glanced at the speaker a little curiously. He had known
      Julian since he was a boy but had never regarded him as anything but a
      dilettante.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may not know it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you are practically expounding the
      views of that extraordinary writer of whom we were speaking&mdash;Paul
      Fiske.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told,&rdquo; the Bishop remarked, cracking a walnut, &ldquo;that Paul
      Fiske is the pseudonym of a Cabinet Minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Hannaway Wells retorted, &ldquo;have been informed most credibly that
      he is a Church of England clergyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last rumour I heard,&rdquo; Lord Shervinton put in, &ldquo;was that he is a
      grocer in a small way of business at Wigan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; Doctor Lennard remarked. &ldquo;The gossips have covered enough
      ground! A man at a Bohemian club of which I am a member&mdash;the Savage
      Club, in fact&mdash;assured me that he was an opium drugged journalist,
      kept alive by the charity of a few friends; a human wreck, who was once
      the editor of an important London paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some slight connection with journalism, have you not, Julian?&rdquo;
       the Earl asked his son condescendingly. &ldquo;Have you heard no reports?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many,&rdquo; Julian replied, &ldquo;but none which I have been disposed to credit. I
      should imagine, myself, that Paul Fiske is a man who believes, having
      created a public, that his written words find an added value from the fact
      that he obviously desires neither reward nor recognition; just in the same
      way as the really earnest democrats of twenty years ago scoffed at the
      idea of a seat in Parliament, or of breaking bread in any way with the
      enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a fine spirit, that,&rdquo; the Bishop declared. &ldquo;I am not sure that we
      are not all of us a little over-inclined towards compromises. The sapping
      away of conscience is so easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dining-room door was thrown open, and the butler announced a visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Henderson, your lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all turned around in their places. The colonel, a fine,
      military-looking figure of a man, shook hands with Lord Maltenby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My most profound apologies, sir,&rdquo; he said, as he accepted a chair. &ldquo;The
      Countess was kind enough to say that if I were not able to get away in
      time for dinner, I might come up afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure that you have dined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had something at Mess, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass of port, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel helped himself from the decanter which was passed towards him
      and exchanged greetings with several of the guests to whom his host
      introduced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No raids or invasions, I hope, Colonel?&rdquo; the latter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing quite so serious as that, I am glad to say. We have had a little
      excitement of another sort, though. One of my men caught a spy this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one was interested. Even after three years of war, there was still
      something fascinating about the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; Lord Maltenby exclaimed. &ldquo;I should scarcely have considered our
      out-of-the-way part of the world sufficiently important to attract
      attentions of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a matter of communication,&rdquo; the Colonel confided. &ldquo;There was an
      enemy submarine off here last night, and we have reason to believe that a
      message was landed. We caught one fellow just at dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do with him?&rdquo; the Bishop asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shot him an hour ago,&rdquo; was the cool reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any others at large?&rdquo; Julian enquired, leaning forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One other,&rdquo; the Colonel acknowledged, sipping his wine appreciatively.
      &ldquo;My military police here, however, are very intelligent, and I should
      think it very doubtful whether he can escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the man who was shot a foreigner?&rdquo; the Earl asked. &ldquo;I trust that he
      was not one of my tenants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a stranger,&rdquo; was the prompt assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his companion?&rdquo; Julian ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His companion is believed to have been quite a youth. There is a
      suggestion that he escaped in a motor-car, but he is probably hiding in
      the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Maltenby frowned. There seemed to him something incongruous in the
      fact that a deed of this sort should have been committed in his domain
      without his knowledge. He rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess is probably relying upon some of us for bridge,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      hope, Colonel, that you will take a hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men rose and filed slowly out of the room. The Colonel, however,
      detained his host, and Julian also lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, Lord Maltenby,&rdquo; the former said, &ldquo;that you will excuse my men,
      but they tell me that they find it necessary to search your garage for a
      car which has been seen in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search my garage?&rdquo; Lord Maltenby repeated, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt,&rdquo; the Colonel explained, &ldquo;that a car was made use of
      last night by the man who is still at large, and it is very possible that
      it was stolen. You will understand, I am sure, that any enquiries which my
      men may feel it their duty to make are actuated entirely by military
      necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; the Earl acceded, still a little puzzled. &ldquo;You will find my
      head chauffeur a most responsible man. He will, I am sure, give them every
      possible information. So far as I am aware, however, there is no strange
      car in the garage. Do you know of any, Julian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Miss Abbeway&rsquo;s,&rdquo; his son replied. &ldquo;Her little Panhard was out in the
      avenue all night, waiting for her to put some plugs in. Every one else
      seems to have come by train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel raised his eyebrows very slightly and moved slowly towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is in the hands of my police,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if you could
      excuse me for half a moment, Lord Maltenby, I should like to speak to your
      head chauffeur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; the Earl replied. &ldquo;I will take you round to the garage
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Julian entered the drawing-room hurriedly a few minutes later. He glanced
      around quickly, conscious of a distinct feeling of disappointment. His
      mother, who was arranging a bridge table, called him over to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the air, my dear boy, of missing some one,&rdquo; she remarked with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want particularly to speak to Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he confided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Maltenby smiled tolerantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After nearly two hours of conversation at dinner! Well, I won&rsquo;t keep you
      in suspense. She wanted a quiet place to write some letters, so I sent her
      into the boudoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian hastened off, with a word of thanks. The boudoir was a small room
      opening from the suite which had been given to the Princess and her niece
      a quaint, almost circular apartment, hung with faded blue Chinese silk and
      furnished with fragments of the Louis Seize period,&mdash;a rosewood
      cabinet, in particular, which had come from Versailles, and which was
      always associated in Julian&rsquo;s mind with the faint fragrance of two Sevres
      jars of dried rose leaves. The door opened almost noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, who was seated before a small, ebony writing table, turned her
      head at his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian listened for a moment and then closed the door. She sat watching
      him, with the pen still in her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you heard any news this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pen with which she had been tapping the table was suddenly motionless.
      She turned a little farther around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;No! Is there any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man was caught upon the marshes this morning and shot an hour ago. They
      say that he was a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat as though turned to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The military police are still hunting for his companion. They are now
      searching the garage here to see if they can find a small, grey, coupe
      car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time she remained speechless, but all those ill-defined fears which
      had gathered in his heart seemed suddenly to come to a head. Her
      appearance had changed curiously during the last hour. There was a hunted,
      almost a desperate gleam in her eyes, a drawn look about her mouth as she
      sat looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colonel of the regiment stationed here has just arrived. He is down
      in the garage now with my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Most Dieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to help you,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes questioned him almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what it means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you guess the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remembered your mouth,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I saw your car last night, and I
      traced it up the avenue this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mouth isn&rsquo;t much to go by,&rdquo; she observed, with a very wan smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happens to be your mouth,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet and stood for a moment as though listening. Then she
      thrust her hand down into the bosom of her gown and produced a small roll
      of paper wrapped in a sheet of oilskin. He took it from her at once and
      slipped it into the breast pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand what you are doing?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly;&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room towards the hearthrug and stood there for a moment,
      leaning against the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything else I can do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned around. There was a wonderful change in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one saw me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not think that there is any one but you
      who could positively identify the car. Neither my aunt nor the maid who is
      with us has any idea that I left my room last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely destroyed,&rdquo; she assured him with a smile. &ldquo;Some day I hope
      I&rsquo;ll find courage to ask you whether you thought them becoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he retorted, a little grimly, &ldquo;I am going to have a very
      serious talk with you, Miss Abbeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be very stern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no response to her lighter mood. The appeal in her eyes left him
      colder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to save your life,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and I mean to do it. At the same
      time, I cannot forget your crime or my complicity in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel like that, then,&rdquo; she said a little defiantly, &ldquo;tell the
      truth. I knew the risk I was running. I am not afraid, even now. You can
      give me back those papers, if you like. I can assure you that the person
      on whom they are found will undoubtedly be shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall certainly retain possession of them,&rdquo; he decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very chivalrous, sir,&rdquo; she ventured, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happen to be only selfish,&rdquo; Julian replied. &ldquo;I even despise myself for
      what I am doing. I am turning traitor myself, simply because I could not
      bear the thought of what might happen to you if you were discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like me, then, a little, Mr. Orden?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four hours ago,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I had hoped to answer that question
      before it was asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very tantalising,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You are going to save my life,
      then, and afterwards treat me as though I were a leper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you may have explanations&mdash;that I may
      find&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand and stopped him. Once more, for a moment, her eyes
      were distended, her form was tense. She was listening intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some one coming,&rdquo; she whispered&mdash;&ldquo;two or three men, I
      think. What fools we have been! We ought to have decided&mdash;about the
      car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her teeth came together for a moment. It was her supreme effort at
      self-control. Then she laughed almost naturally, lit a cigarette, and
      seated herself upon the arm of an easy-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are interfering shockingly with my correspondence,&rdquo; she declared,
      &ldquo;and I am sure that they want you for bridge. Here comes Lord Maltenby to
      tell you so,&rdquo; she added, glancing towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Maltenby was very pompous, very stiff, and yet apologetic. He
      considered the whole affair in which he had become involved ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I beg to present to you Colonel Henderson. An
      unfortunate occurrence took place here last night, which it has become the
      duty of&mdash;er&mdash;Colonel Henderson to clear up. He wishes to ask you
      a question concerning&mdash;er&mdash;a motor-car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Henderson frowned. He stepped a little forward with the air of
      wishing to exclude the Earl from further speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;whether the small coupe car,
      standing about a hundred yards down the back avenue, is yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she assented, with a little sigh. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t go?&rdquo; the Colonel repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you might know something about cars,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;They tell
      me that two of the sparking plugs are cracked. I am thinking of replacing
      them tomorrow morning, if I can get Mr. Orden to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has the car been there in its present condition, then?&rdquo; the
      Colonel enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since about five o&rsquo;clock yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it possible that it could have been out on the road
      anywhere last night, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out on the road!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Why, I couldn&rsquo;t get it up to the garage!
      You go and look at it, Colonel, if you understand cars. Fellowes, the
      chauffeur here, had a look at the plugs when I brought it in, and you&rsquo;ll
      find that they haven&rsquo;t been touched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; the Earl intervened, &ldquo;that my chauffeur offered to do what was
      necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he did, Lord Maltenby,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;I am trying hard to
      be my own mechanic, though, and I have set my mind on changing those plugs
      myself to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are your own chauffeur, then, Miss Abbeway?&rdquo; her inquisitor asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can change a wheel, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theoretically I can, but as a matter of fact I have never had to do it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your tyres,&rdquo; Colonel Henderson continued, &ldquo;are of somewhat unusual
      pattern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are Russian,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I bought them for that reason. As a
      matter of fact, they are very good tyres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; the Colonel said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you are aware that
      my police are in search of a spy who is reported to have escaped from the
      marshes last night in a small motor-car which was left at a certain spot
      in the Salthouse road. I do not believe that there are two tyres such as
      yours in Norfolk. How do you account for their imprint being clearly
      visible along the road to a certain spot near Salthouse? My police have
      taken tracings of them this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine remained perfectly speechless. A slow smile of triumph dawned
      upon her accuser&rsquo;s lips. Lord Maltenby&rsquo;s eyebrows were upraised as though
      in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Julian interposed, &ldquo;I can explain the tyre marks upon the road.
      Miss Abbeway drove me down to Furley&rsquo;s cottage, where I spent the night,
      late in the afternoon. The marks were still there when I returned this
      morning, because I noticed them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same marks?&rdquo; the Colonel asked, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt the same marks,&rdquo; Julian replied. &ldquo;In one place, where we
      skidded a little, I recognized them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Henderson smiled a little more naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to have hopes,&rdquo; he acknowledged frankly, &ldquo;that I have been drawn
      into another mare&rsquo;s nest. Nevertheless, I am bound to ask you this
      question, Miss Abbeway. Did you leave your room at all during last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless I walked in my sleep,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but you had better make
      enquiries of my aunt, and Parkins, our maid. They sleep one on either side
      of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not object,&rdquo; the Colonel continued, more cheerfully still, &ldquo;if
      my people thought well to have your things searched?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Catherine replied coolly, &ldquo;only if you unpack my
      trunks, I beg that you will allow my maid to fold and unfold my clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; Colonel Henderson said to Lord Maltenby, &ldquo;that I have
      any more questions to ask Miss Abbeway at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which case we will return to the drawing-room,&rdquo; the Earl suggested a
      little stiffly. &ldquo;Miss Abbeway, you will, I trust, accept my apologies for
      our intrusion upon you. I regret that any guest of mine should have been
      subjected to a suspicion so outrageous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not outrageous really, dear Lord Maltenby,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not quite
      know of what I have been suspected, but I am sure Colonel Henderson would
      not have asked me these questions if it had not been his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had not been a guest in this house, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; the Colonel
      assured her, with some dignity, &ldquo;I should have had you arrested first and
      questioned afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come of a race of men, Colonel Henderson, who win wars,&rdquo; she declared
      graciously. &ldquo;You know your own mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be joining us presently, I hope?&rdquo; Lord Maltenby enquired from
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a very few minutes,&rdquo; she promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed behind them. Catherine waited for a moment, then she sank
      a little hysterically into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot avoid a touch of melodrama, you see,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;It goes
      with my character and nationality. But seriously, now that that is over, I
      do not consider myself in the slightest danger. The poor fellow who was
      shot this morning belongs to a different order of people. He has been a
      spy over here since the beginning of the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed up in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quite attractive young woman,&rdquo; she declared,&mdash;&ldquo;at least I feel
      sure you will think so when you know me better.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was about half-past ten on the following morning when Julian, obeying a
      stentorian invitation to enter, walked into Miles Furley&rsquo;s sitting room.
      Furley was stretched upon the couch, smoking a pipe and reading the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good man!&rdquo; was his hearty greeting. &ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d look me up this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian dragged up the other dilapidated-looking easy-chair to the log fire
      and commenced to fill his pipe from the open jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the leg?&rdquo; he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty nearly all right again,&rdquo; Furley answered cheerfully. &ldquo;Seems to me
      I was frightened before I was hurt. What about your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No inconvenience at all,&rdquo; Julian declared, stretching himself out. &ldquo;I
      suppose I must have a pretty tough skull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News enough, of a sort, if you haven&rsquo;t heard it. They caught the man who
      sandbagged me, and who I presume sawed your plank through, and shot him
      last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil they did!&rdquo; Furley exclaimed, taking his pipe from his mouth.
      &ldquo;Shot him? Who the mischief was he, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears,&rdquo; Julian replied, &ldquo;that he was a German hairdresser, who
      escaped from an internment camp two years ago and has been at large ever
      since, keeping in touch, somehow or other, with his friends on the other
      side. He must have known the game was up as soon as he was caught. He
      didn&rsquo;t even attempt any defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot, eh?&rdquo; Furley repeated, relighting his pipe. &ldquo;Serves him damned well
      right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so, do you?&rdquo; Julian remarked pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t? I hate espionage. So does every Englishman. That&rsquo;s why we
      are such duffers at the game, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian watched his friend with a slight frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in thunder did you get mixed up with this affair, Furley?&rdquo; he asked
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furley&rsquo;s bewilderment was too natural to be assumed. He removed his pipe
      from his teeth and stared at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are you driving at, Julian?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I can assure
      you that I went out, the night before last, simply to make one of the
      rounds which falls to my lot when I am in this part of the world and
      nominated for duty. There are eleven of us between here and Sheringham,
      special constables of a humble branch of the secret service, if you like
      to put it so. We are a well-known institution amongst the initiated. I&rsquo;ve
      plodded these marshes sometimes from midnight till daybreak, and although
      one&rsquo;s always hearing rumours, until last night I have never seen or heard
      of a single unusual incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no idea, then,&rdquo; Julian persisted, &ldquo;what it was that you were on
      the look-out for the night before last? You had no idea, say, from any
      source whatever, that there was going to be an attempt on the part of the
      enemy to communicate with friends on this side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, no! Even to have known it would have been treason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley drew himself stiffly up in his chair. His mass of brown hair seemed
      more unkempt than usual, his hard face sterner than ever by reason of its
      disfiguring frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the hell do you mean, Julian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; Julian replied, &ldquo;that I have reason to suspect you, Furley, of
      holding or attempting to hold secret communication with an enemy country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pipestem which he was holding snapped in Furley&rsquo;s fingers. His eyes
      were filled with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you, Julian!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If I could stand on two legs, I&rsquo;d break
      your head. How dare you come here and talk such rubbish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some truth in what I have just said?&rdquo; Julian asked sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian was silent for a moment. Furley was sitting upright upon the sofa,
      his keen eyes aglint with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting for an explanation, Julian,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;The companion of the man who
      was shot, for whom the police are searching at this moment, is a guest in
      my father&rsquo;s house. I have had to go to the extent of lying to save her
      from detection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her?&rdquo; Furley gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! The youth in fisherman&rsquo;s oilskins, into whose hands that message
      passed last night, is Miss Catherine Abbeway. The young lady has referred
      me to you for some explanation as to its being in her possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley remained absolutely speechless for several moments. His first
      expression was one of dazed bewilderment. Then the light broke in upon
      him. He began to understand. When he spoke, all the vigour had left his
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to let me think about this for a moment, Julian,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your own time. I only want an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley recovered himself slowly. He stretched out his hand towards the
      pipe rack, filled another pipe and lit it. Then he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every word that I have spoken to you about the night
      before last is the truth. There is a further confession, however, which
      under the circumstances I have to make. I belong to a body of men who are
      in touch with a similar association in Germany, but I have no share in any
      of the practical doings&mdash;the machinery, I might call it&mdash;of our
      organisation. I have known that communications have passed back and forth,
      but I imagined that this was done through neutral countries. I went out
      the night before last as an ordinary British citizen, to do my duty. I had
      not the faintest idea that there was to be any attempt to land a
      communication here, referring to the matters in which I am interested. I
      should imagine that the proof, of my words lies in the fact that efforts
      were made to prevent my reaching my beat, and that you, my substitute,
      whom I deliberately sent to take my place, were attacked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your word so far,&rdquo; Julian said. &ldquo;Please go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an Englishman and a patriot,&rdquo; Furley continued, &ldquo;just as much as you
      are, although you are a son of the Earl of Maltenby, and you fought in the
      war. You must listen to me without prejudice. There are thoughtful men in
      England, patriots to the backbone, trying to grope their way to the truth
      about this bloody sacrifice. There are thoughtful men in Germany on the
      same tack. If, for the betterment of the world, we should seek to come
      into touch with one another, I do not consider that treason, or
      communicating with an enemy country in the ordinary sense of the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Julian muttered. &ldquo;What you are prepared to plead guilty to is
      holding communication with members of the Labour and Socialist Party in
      Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I plead guilty to nothing,&rdquo; Furley answered, with a touch of his old
      fierceness. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like your father and his class, Julian. Get away
      from it. Be yourself. Your Ministers can&rsquo;t end the war. Your Government
      can&rsquo;t. They opened their mouth too wide at first. They made too many
      commitments. Ask Stenson. He&rsquo;ll tell you that I&rsquo;m speaking the truth. So
      it goes on, and day by day it costs the world a few hundred or a few
      thousand human lives, and God knows how much of man&rsquo;s labour and brains,
      annihilated, wasted, blown into the air! Somehow or other the war has got
      to stop, Julian. If the politicians won&rsquo;t do it, the people must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people,&rdquo; Julian repeated a little sadly. &ldquo;Rienzi once trusted in the
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a difference,&rdquo; Furley protested. &ldquo;Today the people are all right,
      but the Rienzi isn&rsquo;t here&mdash;My God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off suddenly, pursuing another train of thought. He leaned
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll talk about the fate of that communication
      later. What about Miss Abbeway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; Julian told him, &ldquo;was in imminent danger last night of
      arrest as a spy. Against my principles and all my convictions, I have done
      my best to protect her against the consequences of her ridiculous and
      inexcusable conduct. I don&rsquo;t know anything about your association, Furley,
      but I consider you a lot of rotters to allow a girl to take on a job like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley&rsquo;s eyes flashed in sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a cowardly action, Julian,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hot with shame when I
      think of it. But don&rsquo;t, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, think I had anything to do with
      the affair! We have a secret service branch which arranges for those
      things. It&rsquo;s that skunk Fenn who&rsquo;s responsible. Damn him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholas Fenn, the pacifist!&rdquo; Julian exclaimed. &ldquo;So you take vermin like
      that into your councils!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t call him too hard a name for me at this moment,&rdquo; Furley
      muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholas Fenn,&rdquo; Julian repeated, with a new light in his eyes. &ldquo;Why, the
      cable I censored was to him! So he&rsquo;s the arch traitor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholas Fenn is in it;&rdquo; Furley admitted, &ldquo;although I deny that there&rsquo;s
      any treason whatever in the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense!&rdquo; Julian replied. &ldquo;What about your German hairdresser
      who was shot this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a mistake to make use of him,&rdquo; Furley confessed. &ldquo;Fenn has
      deceived us all as to the method of our communications. But listen,
      Julian. You&rsquo;ll be able to get Miss Abbeway out of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Julian replied, &ldquo;I shall be in it myself, for I&rsquo;ve lied
      myself black in the face already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a man, for all the starch in you, Julian,&rdquo; Furley declared. &ldquo;If
      anything were to happen to that girl, I&rsquo;d wring Fenn&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s safe for the present,&rdquo; Julian pronounced. &ldquo;You see, she
      isn&rsquo;t in possession of the incriminating document. I took it from her when
      she was in danger of arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have much doubt about that,&rdquo; was the composed reply. &ldquo;I shall
      go to town to-morrow and hand it over to the proper authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian rose to his feet as he spoke. Furley looked at him helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in heaven&rsquo;s name, man,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;shall I be able to make you see
      the truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A touch of the winter sunlight was upon Julian&rsquo;s face which, curiously
      enough, at that moment resembled his father&rsquo;s in its cold, patrician
      lines. The mention of Nicholas Fenn&rsquo;s name seemed to have transformed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, Furley,&rdquo; he advised, &ldquo;for the sake of our friendship, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t try. There is no consideration in the world which would alter my
      intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of the lifting of the outer latch, a knock at the
      door. The incoming visitors stood upon no ceremony. Mr. Stenson and
      Catherine showed themselves upon the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stenson waved aside all ceremony and at once checked Furley&rsquo;s attempt
      to rise to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t get up, Furley,&rdquo; he begged, shaking hands with him. &ldquo;I hope
      you&rsquo;ll forgive such an informal visit. I met Miss Abbeway on my way down
      to the sea, and when she told me that she was coming to call on you, I
      asked leave to accompany her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very welcome, sir,&rdquo; was the cordial response. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honour
      which I scarcely expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian found chairs for every one, and Mr. Stenson, recognising
      intuitively a certain state of tension, continued his good-humoured
      remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway and I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have been having a most interesting
      conversation, or rather argument. I find that she is entirely of your way
      of thinking, Furley. You both belong to the order of what I call puffball
      politicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine laughed heartily at the simile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stenson is a glaring example,&rdquo; she pointed out, &ldquo;of those who do not
      know their own friends. Mr. Furley and I both believe that some time or
      other our views will appeal to the whole of the intellectual and unselfish
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible job to get people to think,&rdquo; Furley observed. &ldquo;They are
      nearly always busy doing something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these aristocrats!&rdquo; Catherine continued, smiling at Julian. &ldquo;You
      spoil them so in England, you know. Eton and Oxford are simply terrible in
      their narrowing effect upon your young men. It&rsquo;s like putting your raw
      material into a sausage machine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway is very severe this morning,&rdquo; Stenson declared, with
      unabated good humour. &ldquo;She has been attacking my policy and my principles
      during the whole of our walk. Bad luck about your accident, Furley. I
      suppose we should have met whilst I am down here, if you hadn&rsquo;t developed
      too adventurous a spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley glanced at Julian and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure about that, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your host doesn&rsquo;t approve of
      me very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do political prejudices exist so far from their home?&rdquo; Mr. Stenson asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid my father is rather old-fashioned,&rdquo; Julian confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all old-fashioned&mdash;and stiff with prejudice,&rdquo; Furley
      declared. &ldquo;Even Orden,&rdquo; he went on, turning to Catherine, &ldquo;only tolerates
      me because we ate dinners off the same board when we were both making up
      our minds to be Lord High Chancellor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend Furley,&rdquo; Julian confided, as he leaned across the table and
      took a cigarette, &ldquo;has no tact and many prejudices. He does write such
      rubbish about the aristocracy. I remember an article of his not very long
      ago, entitled &lsquo;Out with our Peers!&rsquo; It&rsquo;s all very well for a younger son
      like me to take it lying down, but you could scarcely expect my father to
      approve. Besides, I believe the fellow&rsquo;s a renegade. I have an idea that
      he was born in the narrower circles himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong, then,&rdquo; Furley grunted with satisfaction. &ldquo;My
      father was a boot manufacturer in a country village of Leicestershire. I
      went in for the Bar because he left me pots of money, most of which, by
      the bye, I seem to have dissipated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiefly in Utopian schemes for the betterment of his betters,&rdquo; Julian
      observed drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly had an idea,&rdquo; Furley confessed, &ldquo;of an asylum for incapable
      younger sons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call a truce,&rdquo; Julian proposed. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t polite to spar before Miss
      Abbeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson declared, &ldquo;this is a veritable temple of peace. I
      arrived here literally on all fours. Miss Abbeway has proved to me quite
      conclusively that as a democratic leader I have missed my vocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him reproachfully. Nevertheless, his words seemed to have
      brought back to her mind the thrill of their brief but stimulating
      conversation. A flash of genuine earnestness transformed her face, just as
      a gleam of wintry sunshine, which had found its way in through the open
      window, seemed to discover threads of gold in her tightly braided and
      luxuriant brown hair. Her eyes filled with an almost inspired light:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stenson is scarcely fair to me,&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;I did not presume
      to criticise his statesmanship, only there are some things here which seem
      pitiful. England should be the ideal democracy of the world. Your laws
      admit of it, your Government admits of it. Neither birth nor money are
      indispensable to success. The way is open for the working man to pass even
      to the Cabinet. And you are nothing of the sort. The cause of the people
      is not in any country so shamefully and badly represented. You have a
      bourgeoisie which maintains itself in almost feudal luxury by means of the
      labour which it employs, and that labour is content to squeak and open its
      mouth for worms, when it should have the finest fruits of the world. And
      all this is for want of leadership. Up you come you David Sands, you
      Phineas Crosses, you Nicholas Fenns, you Thomas Evanses. You each think
      that you represent Labour, but you don&rsquo;t. You represent trade&mdash;the
      workers at one trade. How they laugh at you, the men who like to keep the
      government of this country in their own possession! They stretch down a
      hand to the one who has climbed the highest, they pull him up into the
      Government, and after that Labour is well quit of him. He has found his
      place with the gods. Perhaps they will make him a &lsquo;Sir&rsquo; and his wife a
      &lsquo;Lady,&rsquo; but for him it is all over with the Cause. And so another ten
      years is wasted, while another man grows up to take his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right enough,&rdquo; Furley confessed gloomily. &ldquo;There is something about
      the atmosphere of the inner life of politics which has proved fatal to
      every Labour man who has ever climbed. Paul Fiske wrote the same thing
      only a few weeks ago. He thought that it was the social atmosphere which
      we still preserve around our politics. We no sooner catch a clever man,
      born of the people, than we dress him up like a mummy and put him down at
      dinner parties and garden parties, to do things he&rsquo;s not accustomed to,
      and expect him to hold his own amongst people who are not his people.
      There is something poisonous about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you all rather assuming,&rdquo; Stenson suggested drily, &ldquo;that the
      Labour Party is the only party in politics worth considering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they knew their own strength,&rdquo; Catherine declared, &ldquo;they would be the
      predominant party. Should you like to go to the polls to-day and fight for
      your seats against them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; Mr. Stenson exclaimed. &ldquo;But then we&rsquo;ve made up our mind
      to one thing&mdash;no general election during the war. Afterwards, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if Unionists and Liberals and even Radicals
      didn&rsquo;t amalgamate and make one party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fight Labour,&rdquo; Furley said grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep England great,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson replied. &ldquo;You must remember that so
      far as any scheme or program which the Labour Party has yet disclosed, in
      this country or any other, they are preeminently selfish. England has
      mighty interests across the seas. A parish-council form of government
      would very soon bring disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian glanced at the clock and rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurry any one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but my father is rather a
      martinet about luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all rose. Mr. Stenson turned to Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go on with Miss Abbeway?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I will catch up with you
      on the marshes. I want to have just a word with Furley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian and his companion crossed the country road and passed through the
      gate opposite on to the rude track which led down almost to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very interested in English labour questions, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he
      remarked, &ldquo;considering that you are only half an Englishwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only the English labouring classes in whom I am interested,&rdquo; she
      replied impatiently. &ldquo;It is the cause of the people throughout the whole
      of the world which in my small way I preach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own country,&rdquo; he continued, a little diffidently, &ldquo;is scarcely a
      good advertisement for the cause of social reform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone trembled with indignation as she answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own country,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has suffered for so many centuries from such
      terrible oppression that the reaction was bound, in its first stages, to
      produce nothing but chaos. Automatically, all that seems to you
      unreasonable, wicked even, in a way, horrible&mdash;will in the course of
      time disappear. Russia will find herself. In twenty years&rsquo; time her
      democracy will have solved the great problem, and Russia be the foremost
      republic of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;she is letting us down pretty badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are selfish, you English!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You see one of the
      greatest nations in the world going through its hour of agony, and you
      think nothing but how you yourselves will be affected! Every thinking
      person in Russia regrets that this thing should have come to pass at such
      a time. Yet it is best for you English to look the truth in the face. It
      wasn&rsquo;t the Russian people who were pledged to you, with whom you were
      bound in alliance. It was that accursed trick all European politicians
      have of making secret treaties and secret understandings, building up
      buffer States, trying to whittle away a piece of the map for yourselves,
      trying all the time to be dishonest under the shadow of what is called
      diplomacy. That is what brought the war about. It was never the will of
      the people. It was the Hohenzollerns and the Romanoffs, the firebrands of
      the French Cabinet, and your own clumsy, thick-headed efforts to get the
      best of everybody and yet keep your Nonconformist conscience. The people
      did not make this war, but it is the people who are going to end it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked in silence for some minutes, he apparently pondering over her
      last words, she with the cloud passing from her face as, with her head a
      little thrown back and her eyes half-closed, she sniffed the strong, salty
      air with an almost voluptuous expression of content. She was perfectly
      dressed for the country, from her square-toed shoes, which still seemed to
      maintain some distinction of shape, the perfectly tailored coat and skirt,
      to the smart little felt hat with its single quill. She walked with the
      free grace of an athlete, unembarrassed with the difficulties of the way
      or the gusts which swept across the marshy places, yet not even the
      strengthening breeze, which as they reached the sea line became almost a
      gale, seemed to have power to bring even the faintest flush of colour to
      her cheeks. They reached the long headland and stood looking out at the
      sea before she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very kind to me last night, Mr. Orden,&rdquo; she said, a little
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid a debt,&rdquo; he reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is something in that,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I really believe
      that that exceedingly unpleasant person with whom I was brought into
      temporary association would have killed you if I had allowed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am inclined to agree with you,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;I saw him very hazily,
      but a more criminal type of countenance I never beheld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that we are quits,&rdquo; she ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a little debt on my side still to be paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is no telling what demands I may make upon our acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acquaintance?&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to call it friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very short time ago;&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;even friendship would not
      have satisfied me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dislike mysteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor me!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;However, you can rid yourself of the shadow of one
      as soon as you like after luncheon. It would be quite safe now, I think,
      for me to take back that packet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assented slowly, &ldquo;I suppose that it would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up into his face. Something that she saw there brought her own
      delicate eyebrows together in a slight frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will give it me after lunch?&rdquo; she proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were only entrusted with it for a time,&rdquo; she reminded him, with
      ominous calm. &ldquo;It belongs to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A document received in this surreptitious fashion,&rdquo; he pronounced, &ldquo;is
      presumably a treasonable document. I have no intention of returning it to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked by his side for a few moments in silence. Glancing down into
      her face, Julian was almost startled. There were none of the ordinary
      signs of anger there, but an intense white passion, the control of which
      was obviously costing her a prodigious effort. She touched his fingers
      with her ungloved hand as she stepped over a stile, and he found them icy
      cold. All the joy of that unexpectedly sunny morning seemed to have
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he said almost humbly, &ldquo;that you take my
      decision so hardly. I ask you to remember that I am just an ordinary,
      typical Englishman, and that I have already lied for your sake. Will you
      put yourself in my place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had climbed the little ridge of grass-grown sand and stood looking
      out seaward. Suddenly all the anger seemed to pass from her face. She
      lifted her head, her soft brown eyes flashed into his, the little curl of
      her lips seemed to transform her whole expression. She was no longer the
      gravely minded prophetess of a great cause, the scheming woman, furious at
      the prospect of failure. She was suddenly wholly feminine, seductive, a
      coquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were just an ordinary, stupid, stolid Englishman,&rdquo; she whispered,
      &ldquo;why did you risk your honour and your safety for my sake? Will you tell
      me that, dear man of steel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian leaned even closer over her. She was smiling now frankly into his
      face, refusing the warning of his burning eyes. Then suddenly, silently,
      he held her to him and kissed her, unresisting, upon the lips. She made no
      protest. He even fancied afterwards, when he tried to rebuild in his mind
      that queer, passionate interlude, that her lips had returned what his had
      given. It was he who released her&mdash;not she who struggled. Yet he
      understood. He knew that this was a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stenson&rsquo;s voice reached them from the other side of the ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and show me the way across this wretched bit of marsh, Orden. I
      don&rsquo;t like these deceptive green grasses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pitfalls for the Politician&rsquo; or &lsquo;Look before you leap&rsquo;.&rdquo; Julian muttered
      aimlessly. &ldquo;Quite right to avoid that spot, sir. Just follow where I am
      pointing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stenson made his laborious way to their side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be a short cut back to the Hall,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;but except for
      the view of the sea and this gorgeous air, I think I should have preferred
      the main road! Help me up, Orden. Isn&rsquo;t it somewhere near here that that
      little affair happened the other night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very spot,&rdquo; Julian assented. &ldquo;Miss Abbeway and I were just speaking
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both glanced towards her. She was standing with her back to them,
      looking out seawards. She did not move even at the mention of her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dreary spot at night, I dare say,&rdquo; the Prime Minister remarked, without
      overmuch interest. &ldquo;How do we get home from here, Orden? I haven&rsquo;t
      forgotten your warning about luncheon, and this air is giving me a most
      lively appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight along the top of this ridge for about three quarters of a mile,
      sir, to the entrance of the harbour there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a petrol launch,&rdquo; Julian explained, &ldquo;and I shall land you
      practically in the dining room in another ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us proceed,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson suggested briskly. &ldquo;What a queer fellow
      Miles Furley is! Quite a friend of yours, isn&rsquo;t he, Miss Abbeway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen a good deal of him lately,&rdquo; she answered, walking on and
      making room for Stenson to fall into step by her side, but still keeping
      her face a little averted. &ldquo;A man of many but confused ideas; a man, I
      should think, who stands an evil chance of muddling his career away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We offered him a post in the Government,&rdquo; Stenson ruminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had just sense enough to refuse that, I suppose,&rdquo; she observed, moving
      slowly to the right and thereby preventing Julian from taking a place by
      her side. &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I find in him the fault of so many
      Englishmen, the fault that prevents their becoming great statesmen, great
      soldiers, or even,&rdquo; she added coolly, &ldquo;successful lovers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; Julian demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained silent. It was as though she had heard nothing. She caught
      Mr. Stenson&rsquo;s arm and pointed to a huge white seagull, drifting down the
      wind above their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with that model, we intellectuals have waited
      nearly two thousand years for the aeroplane!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      According to plans made earlier in the day, a small shooting party left
      the Hall immediately after luncheon and did not return until late in the
      afternoon. Julian, therefore, saw nothing more of Catherine until she came
      into the drawing-room, a few minutes before the announcement of dinner,
      wearing a wonderful toilette of pale blue silk, with magnificent pearls
      around her neck and threaded in her Russian headdress. As is the way with
      all women of genius, Catherine&rsquo;s complete change of toilette indicated a
      parallel change in her demeanour. Her interesting but somewhat subdued
      manner of the previous evening seemed to have vanished. At the dinner
      table she dominated the conversation. She displayed an intimate
      acquaintance with every capital of Europe and with countless personages of
      importance. She exchanged personal reminiscences with Lord Shervinton, who
      had once been attached to the Embassy at Rome, and with Mr. Hannaway
      Wells, who had been first secretary at Vienna. She spoke amusingly of
      Munich, at which place, it appeared, she had first studied art, but
      dilated, with all the artist&rsquo;s fervour, on her travellings in Spain, on
      the soft yet wonderfully vivid colouring of the southern cities. She
      seemed to have escaped altogether from the gravity of which she had
      displayed traces on the previous evening. She was no longer the serious
      young woman with a purpose. From the chrysalis she had changed into the
      butterfly, the brilliant and cosmopolitan young queen of fashion, ruling
      easily, not with the arrogance of rank, but with the actual gifts of charm
      and wit. Julian himself derived little benefit from being her neighbour,
      for the conversation that evening, from first to last, was general. Even
      after she had left the room, the atmosphere which she had created seemed
      to linger behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never rightly understood Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; the Bishop declared. &ldquo;She
      is a most extraordinarily brilliant young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Shervinton assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night you have Catherine Abbeway,&rdquo; he expounded, &ldquo;as she might have
      been but for these queer, alternating crazes of hers&mdash;art and
      socialism. Her brain was developed a little too early, and she was
      unfortunately, almost in her girlhood, thrown in with a little clique of
      brilliant young Russians who attained a great influence over her. Most of
      them are in Siberia or have disappeared by now. One Anna Katinski&mdash;was
      brought back from Tobolsk like a royal princess on the first day of the
      revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; the Earl pronounced didactically, &ldquo;that a young lady of
      Miss Abbeway&rsquo;s birth and gifts should espouse the cause of this Labour
      rabble, a party already cursed with too many leaders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman, when she takes up a cause,&rdquo; Mr. Hannaway Wells observed, &ldquo;always
      seeks either for the picturesque or for something which appeals to the
      emotions. So long as she doesn&rsquo;t mix with them, the cause of the people
      has a great deal to recommend it. One can use beautiful phrases, can
      idealise with a certain amount of logic, and can actually achieve things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we are all a little blind,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;to the danger in which
      we stand through the great prosperity of Labour to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop leaned across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been reading Fiske this week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I quote?&rdquo; Julian asked carelessly. &ldquo;I have a wretched memory. I
      should never dare to become a politician. I should always be passing off
      other people&rsquo;s phrases as my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiske is quite right in his main contention,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson interposed.
      &ldquo;The war is rapidly creating a new class of bourgeoisie. The very
      differences in the earning of skilled labourers will bring trouble before
      long&mdash;the miner with his fifty or sixty shillings, and the munition
      worker with his seven or eight pounds&mdash;men drawn from the same
      class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England,&rdquo; declared the Earl, indulging in his favourite speech, &ldquo;was
      never so contented as when wages were at their lowest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those days will never come again,&rdquo; Mr. Hannaway Wells foretold grimly.
      &ldquo;The working man has tasted blood. He has begun to understand his power.
      Our Ministers have been asleep for a generation. The first of these modern
      trades unions should have been treated like a secret society in Italy.
      Look at them now, and what they represent! Fancy what it will mean when
      they have all learnt to combine!&mdash;when Labour produces real leaders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can any one explain the German democracy?&rdquo; Lord Shervinton enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ubiquitous Fiske was trying to last week in one of the Reviews,&rdquo; Mr.
      Stenson replied. &ldquo;His argument was that Germany alone, of all the nations
      in the world, possessed an extra quality or an extra sense&mdash;I forget
      which he called it&mdash;the sense of discipline. It&rsquo;s born in their
      blood. Generations of military service are responsible for it. Discipline
      and combination&mdash;that might be their motto. Individual thought has
      been drilled into grooves, just as all individual effort is specialised.
      The Germans obey because it is their nature to obey. The only question is
      whether they will stand this, the roughest test they have ever had&mdash;whether
      they&rsquo;ll see the thing through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personally, I think they will,&rdquo; Hannaway Wells pronounced, &ldquo;but if I
      should be wrong&mdash;if they shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;the French Revolution would
      be a picnic compared with the German one. It takes a great deal to drive a
      national idea out of the German mind, but if ever they should understand
      precisely and exactly how they have been duped for the glorification of
      their masters&mdash;well, I should pity the junkers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do your essays in journalism,&rdquo; the Bishop asked politely, &ldquo;ever lead you
      to touch upon Labour subjects, Julian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once or twice, in a very mild way,&rdquo; was the somewhat diffident reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had an interesting talk with Furley this morning,&rdquo; the Prime Minister
      observed. &ldquo;He tells me that they are thinking of making an appeal to this
      man Paul Fiske to declare himself. They want a leader&mdash;they want one
      very badly&mdash;and thank heavens they don&rsquo;t know where to look for him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; Julian protested, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t expect necessarily to find a
      leader of men in an anonymous contributor to the Reviews? Fiske, when they
      have found him, may be a septuagenarian, or a man of academic turn of
      mind, who never leaves his study. &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo; may even be the pseudonym
      of a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl rose from his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I read the latest article of this Paul
      Fiske. In my opinion he is an exceedingly mischievous person, without the
      slightest comprehension of the forces which really count in government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as he left the room with his hand on his
      godson&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be interesting,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;to hear this man Fiske&rsquo;s opinion
      of your father&rsquo;s last speech in the House of Lords upon land interests!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the close of a particularly unsatisfactory evening of
      uninspiring bridge that Julian saw anything more of Catherine. She came in
      from the picture gallery, breathless, followed by four or five of the
      young soldiers, to whom she had been showing the steps of a new dance,
      and, turning to Julian with an impulsiveness which surprised him, laid her
      fingers imperatively upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me somewhere, please, where we can sit down and talk,&rdquo; she begged,
      &ldquo;and give me something to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way into the billiard room and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been overtiring yourself,&rdquo; he said, looking down at her
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I used to dance all through the
      night in Paris and Rome, a few years ago. These young men are so clumsy,
      though&mdash;and I think that I am nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lay back in her chair and half closed her eyes. A servant brought in
      the Evian water for which she had asked and a whisky and soda for Julian.
      She drank thirstily and seemed in a few moments to have overcome her
      fatigue. She turned to her companion with an air of determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must speak to you about that packet, Mr. Orden,&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help it. You forget that with me it is a matter of life or
      death. You must realise that you were only entrusted with it. You are a
      man of honour. Give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of doing with it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take it to London with me to-morrow,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and hand it
      over to a friend of mine at the Foreign Office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would nothing that I could do or say,&rdquo; she asked passionately, &ldquo;influence
      your decision?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything that you do or say interests and affects me,&rdquo; he answered
      simply, &ldquo;but so far as regards this matter, my duty is clear. You have
      nothing to fear from my account of how it came into my possession. It
      would be impossible for me to denounce you for what I fear you are. On the
      other hand, I cannot allow you the fruits of your enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You consider me, I suppose,&rdquo; she observed after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;an
      enemy spy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have proved it,&rdquo; he reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Overman&mdash;my confederate,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;that was true. Of me it
      is not. I am an honest intermediary between the honest people of Germany
      and England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no communication between the two countries during wartime,
      except through official channels,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flashed. She seemed in the throes of one of those little bursts
      of tempestuous passion which sometimes assailed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk&mdash;well, as you might be supposed to talk!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      breaking off with an effort. &ldquo;What have official channels done to end this
      war? I am not here to help either side. I represent simply humanity. If
      you destroy or hand over to the Government that packet, you will do your
      country an evil turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am relieved to hear all that you say,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;and I am heartily
      glad to think that you do not look upon yourself as Overman&rsquo;s associate.
      On the other hand, you must know that any movement towards peace, except
      through the authorised channels, is treason to the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only you were not the Honourable Julian Orden, the son of an English
      peer!&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;If only you had not been to Eton and to Oxford! If
      only you were a man, a man of the people, who could understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither my birth nor my education,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;have affected my
      present outlook upon life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;You talk like a stiffened sheet of foolscap! I am to
      leave here to-morrow, then, without my packet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must certainly leave&mdash;when you do leave&mdash;without that,&rdquo; he
      assented. &ldquo;There is one thing, however, which I very sincerely hope that
      you will leave behind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My forgiveness for what?&rdquo; she asked, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my rashness this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes grew a little larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you kissed me?&rdquo; she observed, without flinching. &ldquo;I have nothing
      to forgive. In fact,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I think that I should have had more to
      forgive if you had not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was puzzled and yet encouraged. She was always bewildering him by her
      sudden changes from the woman of sober thoughtfulness to the woman of
      feeling, the woman eager to give, eager to receive. At that moment it
      seemed as though her sex possessed her to the exclusion of everything
      outside. Her eyes were soft and filled with the desire of love, her lips
      sweet and tremulous. She had suddenly created a new atmosphere around her,
      an atmosphere of bewildering and passionate femininity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me, please, what you mean?&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it clear?&rdquo; she answered, very softly but with a suspicion of scorn
      in her low tones. &ldquo;You kissed me because I deliberately invited it. I know
      that quite well. My anger&mdash;and I have been angry about it&mdash;is
      with myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a little taken aback. Her perfect naturalness was disarming, a
      little confusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly did seem provocative,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;but I ought to have
      remembered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very stupid,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I deliberately invited your embrace.
      Your withholding it would simply have added to my humiliation. I am
      furious with myself, simply because, although I have lived a great part of
      my life with men, on equal terms with them, working with them, playing
      with them, seeing more of them at all times than of my own sex, such a
      thing has never happened to me before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt that,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment her face shone. There was a look of gratitude in her eyes.
      Her impulsive grasp of his hand left his fingers tingling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad that you understood,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Perhaps that will help me
      just a little. For the rest, if you wish to be very kind, you will
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I cannot do that,&rdquo; he promised, &ldquo;I will at least turn the key upon my
      memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do more than that,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Throw the key into the sea, or whatever
      oblivion you choose to conjure up. Moments such as those have no place in
      my life. There is one purpose there more intense than anything else, that
      very purpose which by some grim irony of fate it seems to be within your
      power to destroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent. Ordinary expressions of regret seemed too inadequate.
      Besides, the charm of the moment was passing. The other side of her was
      reasserting itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she went on, a little drearily, &ldquo;that even if I told you upon
      my honour, of my certain knowledge, that the due delivery of that packet
      might save the lives of thousands of your countrymen, might save hearts
      from breaking, homes from becoming destitute&mdash;even if I told you all
      this, would it help me in my prayer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could help you,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;but your whole confidence, and
      even then I fear that the result would be the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you are very hard!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;My confidence belongs to
      others. It is not mine alone to give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I know beforehand that you are speaking the
      truth as you see it. I know beforehand that any scheme in which you are
      engaged is for the benefit of our fellow creatures and not for their harm.
      But alas! you make yourself the judge of these things, and there are times
      when individual effort is the most dangerous thing in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were any one else!&rdquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why be prejudiced about me?&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Believe me, I am not a
      frivolous person. I, too, think of life and its problems. You yourself are
      an aristocrat. Why should not I as well as you have sympathy and feeling
      for those who suffer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Russian,&rdquo; she reminded him, &ldquo;and in Russia it is different.
      Besides, I am no longer an aristocrat. I am a citizeness of the world. I
      have eschewed everything in life except one thing, and for that I have
      worked with all my heart and strength. As for you, what have you done?
      What is your record?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insignificant, I fear,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;You see, a very promising start at
      the Bar was somewhat interfered with by my brief period of soldiering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the present moment you have no definite career,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You
      have even been wasting your time censoring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am returning now to my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your profession!&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;That means you will spend your time
      wrangling with a number of other bewigged and narrow-minded people about
      uninteresting legal technicalities which lead nowhere and which no one
      cares about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my journalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have damned it with your own phrase &lsquo;hack journalism&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may enter Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to preserve your rights,&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;that you haven&rsquo;t a very high opinion of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is within your power to make me look upon you as the bravest, the
      kindest, the most farseeing of men,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline to think that you would think any the better of me for
      committing a dishonourable action for your sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try me,&rdquo; she begged, her hand resting once more upon his. &ldquo;If you want my
      kind feelings, my everlasting gratitude, they are yours. Give me that
      packet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; he declared uncompromisingly. &ldquo;If you wish to alter
      my attitude with regard to it, you must tell me exactly from whom it
      comes, what it contains, and to whom it goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask more than is possible.. You make me almost sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry that I saved your life,&rdquo; she said boldly. &ldquo;Why should I not be?
      There are many who will suffer, many who will lose their lives because of
      your obstinacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you believe that, confide in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only you were different!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a human being,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I have sympathies and heart. I would
      give my life willingly to save any carnage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could never make you understand,&rdquo; she murmured hopelessly. &ldquo;I shall not
      try. I dare not risk failure. Is this room hot, or is it my fancy? Could
      we have a window open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the room and lifted the blind from before one of the high
      windows which opened seawards. In the panel of the wall, between the
      window to which he addressed himself and the next one, was a tall, gilt
      mirror, relic of the days, some hundreds of years ago, when the apartment
      had been used as a drawing-room. Julian, by the merest accident, for the
      pleasure of a stolen glance at Catherine, happened to look in it as he
      leaned over towards the window fastening. For a single moment he stood
      rigid. Catherine had risen to her feet and, without the slightest evidence
      of any fatigue, was leaning, tense and alert, over the tray on which his
      untouched whisky and soda was placed. Her hand was outstretched. He saw a
      little stream of white powder fall into the tumbler. An intense and
      sickening feeling of disappointment almost brought a groan to his lips. He
      conquered himself with an effort, however, opened the window a few inches,
      and returned to his place. Catherine was lying back, her eyes half-closed,
      her arms hanging listlessly on either side of her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that better?&rdquo; he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;Still, I think that if you do not mind, I
      will go to bed. I am troubled with a very rare attack of nerves. Drink
      your whisky and soda, and then will you take me into the drawing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He played with his tumbler thoughtfully. His first impulse was to drop it.
      Intervention, however, was at hand. The door opened, and the Princess
      entered with Lord Shervinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; the former exclaimed. &ldquo;I have been looking for you everywhere,
      child. I am sure that you are quite tired out, and I insist upon your
      going to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish your whisky and soda,&rdquo; Catherine begged Julian, &ldquo;and I will lean
      on your arm as far as the staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fate stretched out her right hand to help him. The Princess took
      possession of her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall look after you myself,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Mr. Orden is wanted to
      play billiards. Lord Shervinton is anxious for a game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; Julian answered promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved to the door and held it open. Catherine gave him her fingers and
      a little half-doubtful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only you were not so cruelly obstinate!&rdquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found no words with which to answer her. The shock of his discovery was
      still upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give me thirty in a hundred, Julian,&rdquo; Lord Shervinton called out
      cheerfully. &ldquo;And shut that door as soon as you can, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.
      There&rsquo;s a most confounded draught.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was at some nameless hour in the early morning when Julian&rsquo;s vigil came
      to an end, when the handle of his door was slowly turned, and the door
      itself pushed open and closed again. Julian, lying stretched upon his bed,
      only half prepared for the night, with a dressing gown wrapped around him,
      continued to breathe heavily, his eyes half-closed, listening intently to
      the fluttering of light garments, the soft, almost noiseless footfall of
      light feet. He heard her shake out his dinner coat, try the pockets, heard
      the stealthy opening and closing of the drawers in his wardrobe. Presently
      the footsteps drew near to his bed. For a moment he was obliged to set his
      teeth. A little waft of peculiar, unanalysable perfume, half-fascinating,
      half-repellent, came to him with a sense of disturbing familiarity. She
      paused by his bedside. He felt her hand steal under the pillow, which his
      head scarcely touched; search the pockets of his dressing gown, search
      even the bed. He listened to her soft breathing. The consciousness of her
      close and intimate presence affected him in an inexplicable manner.
      Presently, to his intense relief, she glided away from his immediate
      neighbourhood, and the moment for which he had waited came. He heard her
      retreating footsteps pass through the communicating door into his little
      sitting room, where he had purposely left a light burning. He slipped
      softly from the bed and followed her. She was bending over an open desk as
      he crossed the threshold. He closed the door and stood with his back to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much warmer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only, you see, it isn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started violently at the sound of his voice, but she did not
      immediately turn around. When she did so, her demeanour was almost a shock
      to him. There was no sign of nervousness or apology in her manner. Her
      eyes flashed at him angrily. She wore a loose red wrap trimmed with white
      fur, a dishabille unusually and provokingly attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were shamming sleep!&rdquo; she exclaimed indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke for a moment. Her eyes fell upon a tumbler of whisky and
      soda, which stood on a round table drawn up by the side of his easy-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not come to bed thirsty,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I had another one
      downstairs&mdash;to which I helped myself. This one I brought up to try if
      I could remember sufficient of my chemistry to determine its contents. I
      have been able to decide, to my great relief, that your intention was
      probably to content yourself with plunging me into only temporary
      slumber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted you out of the way whilst I searched your rooms,&rdquo; she told him
      coolly. &ldquo;If you were not such an obstinate, pig-headed, unkind, prejudiced
      person, it would not have been necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Am I all that? Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she looked as though she were about to strike him with the
      electric torch which she was carrying. With a great effort of
      self-control, however, she changed her mind and threw herself into his
      easy-chair with a little gesture of recklessness. Julian seated himself
      opposite to her. Although she kept her face as far as possible averted, he
      realised more than ever in those few moments that she was really an
      extraordinarily beautiful person. Her very attitude was full of an angry
      grace. The quivering of her lips was the only sign of weakness. Her eyes
      were filled with cold resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am your prisoner. I listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are after that packet, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sagacity!&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;I trusted you with it, and you behaved like
      a brute. You kept it. It has nothing to do with you. You have no right to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us understand one another, once and for all,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I will
      not even discuss the question of rightful or wrongful possession. I have
      the packet, and I am going to keep it. You cannot cajole it out of me, you
      cannot steal it from me. To-morrow I shall take it to London and deliver
      it to my friend at the Foreign Office. Nothing could induce me to change
      my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed suddenly to be caught up in the vortex of a new emotion. All
      the bitterness passed from her expression. She fell on her knees by his
      side, sought his hands, and lifted her face, full of passionate entreaty,
      to his. Her eyes were dimmed with tears, her voice piteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be so cruel, so hard,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I swear before Heaven that
      there is no treason in those papers, that they are the one necessary link
      in a great, humanitarian scheme. Be generous, Mr. Orden. Julian! Give it
      back to me. It is mine. I swear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hands gripped her shoulders. She was conscious that he was looking
      past her, and that there was horror in his eyes. The words died away on
      her lips. She, too, turned her head. The door of the sitting room had been
      opened from outside. Lord Maltenby was standing there in his dressing
      gown, his hand stretched out behind him as though to keep some one from
      following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; he demanded sternly, &ldquo;what is the meaning of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Julian was speechless, bereft of words, or sense of movement.
      Catherine still knelt there, trembling. Then Lord Maltenby was pushed
      unceremoniously to one side. It was the Princess who entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Catherine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl rose slowly to her feet. The Princess was leaning on the back of
      a chair, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and sobbing hysterically.
      Lord Shervinton&rsquo;s voice was heard outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is all this commotion?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, crossed the threshold and remained transfixed. The Earl closed
      the door firmly and stood with his back against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will have no more spectators to this disgraceful
      scene. Julian, kindly remember you are not in your bachelor apartments.
      You are in the house over which your mother presides. Have you any reason
      to offer, or excuse to urge, why I should not ask this young woman to
      leave at daybreak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no excuse, sir,&rdquo; Julian answered, &ldquo;I certainly have a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you would be putting an affront upon the lady who has promised to
      become my wife. I am quite aware that her presence in my sitting room is
      unusual, but under the circumstances I do not feel called upon to offer a
      general explanation. I shall say nothing beyond the fact that a single
      censorious remark will be considered by me as an insult to my affianced
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess abandoned her chorus of mournful sounds and dried her eyes.
      Lord Waltenby was speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why all this mystery?&rdquo; the Princess asked pitifully. &ldquo;It is a great
      event, this. Why did you not tell me, Catherine, when you came to my
      room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been some little misunderstanding,&rdquo; Julian explained. &ldquo;It is
      now removed. It brought us,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;very near tragedy. After what I
      have told you, I beg whatever may seem unusual to you in this visit with
      which Catherine has honoured me will be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Maltenby drew a little breath of relief. Fortunately, he missed that
      slight note of theatricality in Julian&rsquo;s demeanour which might have left
      the situation still dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, Julian,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;there is nothing more to be said
      upon the matter. Miss Abbeway, you will allow me to escort you to your
      room. Such further explanations as you may choose to offer us can be very
      well left now until the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find that the whole blame for this unconventional happening
      devolves upon me,&rdquo; Julian declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was entirely my fault,&rdquo; Catherine murmured repentantly. &ldquo;I am so sorry
      to have given any one cause for distress. I do not know, even now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned towards Julian. He leaned forward and raised her fingers to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every one is a little overwrought. Our
      misunderstanding is finished. Princess, I shall try to win your
      forgiveness to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine is so unusual,&rdquo; she complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian held open the door, and they all filed away down the corridor, from
      which Lord Shervinton had long since beat a hurried retreat. He stood
      there until they reached the bend. Catherine, who was leaning on his
      father&rsquo;s arm, turned around. She waved her hand a little irresolutely. She
      was too far off for him to catch her expression, but there was something
      pathetic in her slow, listless walk, from which all the eager grace of a
      few hours ago seemed to have departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until they were nearing London, on the following afternoon,
      that Catherine awoke from a lethargy during which she had spent the
      greater portion of the journey. From her place in the corner seat of the
      compartment in which they had been undisturbed since leaving Wells, she
      studied her companion through half-closed eyes. Julian was reading an
      article in one of the Reviews and remained entirely unconscious of her
      scrutiny. His forehead was puckered, his mouth a little contemptuous. It
      was obvious that he did not wholly approve of what he was reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, during those few hours of solitude, was conscious of a subtle,
      slowly growing change in her mental attitude towards her companion. Until
      the advent of those dramatic hours at Maltenby, she had regarded him as a
      pleasant, even a charming acquaintance, but as belonging to a type with
      which she was entirely and fundamentally out of sympathy. The cold
      chivalry of his behaviour on the preceding night and the result of her own
      reflections as she sat there studying him made her inclined to doubt the
      complete accuracy of her first judgment. She found something unexpectedly
      intellectual and forceful in his present concentration,&mdash;in the high,
      pale forehead, the deep-set but alert eyes. His long, loose frame was yet
      far from ungainly; his grey tweed suit and well-worn brown shoes the
      careless attire of a man who has no need to rely on his tailor for
      distinction. His hands, too, were strong and capable. She found herself
      suddenly wishing that the man himself were different, that he belonged to
      some other and more congenial type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian, in course of time, laid down the Review which he had been studying
      and looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be in London in three quarters of an hour,&rdquo; he announced
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up and yawned, produced her vanity case, peered into the mirror,
      and used her powder puff with the somewhat piquant assurance of the
      foreigner. Then she closed her dressing case with a snap, pulled down her
      veil, and looked across at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how,&rdquo; she asked demurely, &ldquo;does my fiance propose to entertain me
      this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the exception of one half-hour,&rdquo; he replied unexpectedly, &ldquo;I am
      wholly at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am exacting,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I demand that half-hour also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that I could not allow anything to interfere with one brief
      call which I must pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Downing Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to visit your friend at the Foreign Office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately I have called at my rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked away from him out of the window. Beneath her veil her eyes were
      a little misty. She saw nothing of the trimly partitioned fields, the
      rolling pastoral country. Before her vision tragedies seemed to pass,&mdash;the
      blood-stained paraphernalia of the battlefield, the empty, stricken homes,
      the sobbing women in black, striving to comfort their children whilst
      their own hearts were breaking. When she turned away from the window, her
      face was hardened. Once more she found herself almost hating the man who
      was her companion. Whatever might come afterwards, at that moment she had
      the sensations of a murderess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may know when you sleep to-night,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;that you will be
      the blood-guiltiest man in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not dispute the title,&rdquo; he observed politely, &ldquo;with your friend
      the Hohenzollern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not my friend,&rdquo; she retorted, her tone vibrating with passion. &ldquo;I
      am a traitress in your eyes because I have received a communication from
      Germany. From whom does it come, do you think? From the Court? From the
      Chancellor or one of his myrmidons? Fool! It comes from those who hate the
      whole military party. It comes from the Germany whose people have been
      befooled and strangled throughout the war. It comes from the people whom
      your politicians have sought to reach and failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The suggestion is interesting,&rdquo; he remarked coldly, &ldquo;but improbable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, leaning a little forward and looking at him
      fixedly, &ldquo;if I were really your fiancee&mdash;worse! if I were really your
      wife&mdash;I think that before long I should be a murderess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dislike me as much as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate you! I think you are the most pigheaded, obstinate,
      self-satisfied, ignorant creature who ever ruined a great cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accepted the lash of her words without any sign of offence,&mdash;seemed,
      indeed, inclined to treat them reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;you have wasted a lot of breath in abusing me. Why
      not justify it? Tell me the story of yourself and those who are associated
      with you in this secret correspondence with Germany? If you are working
      for a good end, let me know of it. You blame me for judging you, for
      maintaining a certain definite poise. You are not reasonable, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blame you for being what you are,&rdquo; she answered breathlessly. &ldquo;If you
      were a person who understood, who felt the great stir of humanity outside
      your own little circle, who could look across your seas and realise that
      nationality is accidental and that the brotherhood of man throughout the
      world is the only real fact worthy of consideration&mdash;ah! if you could
      realise these things, I could talk, I could explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You judge me in somewhat arbitrary fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judge you from your life, your prejudices, even the views which you
      have expressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some of us,&rdquo; he reminded her, &ldquo;to whom reticence is a national
      gift. I like what you said just now. Why should you take it for granted
      that I am a narrow squireen? Why shouldn&rsquo;t you believe that I, too, may
      feel the horror of these days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel it personally but not impersonally,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You feel it
      intellectually but not with your heart. You cannot see that a kindred soul
      lives in the Russian peasant and the German labourer, the British toiler
      and the French artificer. They are all pouring out their blood for the
      sake of their dream, a politician&rsquo;s dream. Freedom isn&rsquo;t won by wars. It
      must be won, if ever, by moral sacrifice and not with blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then explain to me,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;exactly what you are doing? What your
      reason is for being in communication with the German Government? Remember
      that the dispatch I intercepted came from no private person in Germany. It
      came from those in authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That again is not true,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I would ask for permission to
      explain all these things to you, if it were not so hopeless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The case of your friends will probably be more hopeless still,&rdquo; he
      reminded her, &ldquo;after to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; she said solemnly. &ldquo;The Russian revolution surprised no
      one. Perhaps an English revolution would shake even your self-confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply. Her blood tingled, and she could have struck him for the
      faint smile, almost of amusement, which for a moment parted his lips. He
      was already on his feet, collecting their belongings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you help me,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;with reference to the explanations which it
      will be necessary to make to your aunt and to my own people? We left this
      morning, if you remember, in order that you might visit the Russian
      Embassy and announce our betrothal. You are, I believe, under an
      engagement to return and stay with my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think about those things to-day,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You may take it
      that I am tired and that you had business. You know my address. May I be
      favoured with yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed her a card and scribbled a telephone number upon it. They were
      in the station now, and their baggage in the hands of separate porters.
      She walked slowly down the platform by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you allow me to say,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;how sorry I am&mdash;for all
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slight uncertainty of his speech pleased her. She looked up at him
      with infinite regret. As they neared the barrier, she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, am more sorry than I can tell you;&rdquo; she said a little
      tremulously. &ldquo;Whatever may come, that is how I feel myself. I am sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They separated almost upon the words. Catherine was accosted by a man at
      whom Julian glanced for a moment in surprise, a man whose dress and
      bearing, confident though it was, clearly indicated some other status in
      life. He glanced at Julian with displeasure, a displeasure which seemed to
      have something of jealousy in its composition. Then he grasped Catherine
      warmly by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome back to London, Miss Abbeway! Your news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her reply was inaudible. Julian quickened his pace and passed out of the
      station ahead of them.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Bishop and the Prime Minister met, one afternoon a few days later, at
      the corner of Horse Guards Avenue. The latter was looking brown and well,
      distinctly the better for his brief holiday. The Bishop, on the contrary,
      was pale and appeared harassed. They shook hands and exchanged for a
      moment the usual inanities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Mr. Stenson,&rdquo; the Bishop asked earnestly, &ldquo;what is the meaning
      of all this Press talk, about peace next month? I have heard a hint that
      it was inspired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong,&rdquo; was the firm reply. &ldquo;I have sent my private secretary
      around to a few of the newspapers this morning. It just happens to be the
      sensation, of the moment, and it&rsquo;s fed all the time from the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing in it, then, really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever. Believe me, Bishop&mdash;and there is no one feeling
      the strain more than I am&mdash;the time has not yet come for peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You politicians!&rdquo; the Bishop sighed. &ldquo;Do you sometimes forget, I wonder,
      that even the pawns you move are human?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can honestly say that I, at any rate, have never forgotten it,&rdquo; Mr.
      Stenson answered gravely. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a man in my Government who has a
      single personal feeling in favour of, or a single benefit to gain, by the
      continuance of this ghastly war. On the other hand, there is scarcely one
      who does not realise that the end is not yet. We have pledged our word,
      the word of the English nation, to a peace based only upon certain
      contingencies. Those contingencies the enemy is not at present prepared to
      accept. There is no immediate reason why he should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you sure of that?&rdquo; the Bishop ventured doubtfully. &ldquo;When you
      speak of Germany, you speak of William of Hohenzollern and his clan. Is
      that Germany? Is theirs the voice of the people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be happy to believe that it was not,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson replied, &ldquo;but
      if that is the case, let them give us a sign of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sign,&rdquo; declared the Bishop, with a gleam of hopefulness in his tone,
      &ldquo;may come, and before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men were on the point of parting. Mr. Stenson turned and walked a
      yard or two with his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, Bishop,&rdquo; he enquired, &ldquo;have you heard any rumours concerning
      the sudden disappearance of our young friend Julian Orden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop for a moment was silent. A passer-by glanced at the two men
      sympathetically. Of the two, he thought, it was the man in spiritual
      charge of a suffering people who showed more sign of the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard rumours,&rdquo; the Bishop acknowledged. &ldquo;Tell me what you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singularly little,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson replied. &ldquo;He left Maltenby with Miss
      Abbeway the day after their engagement, and, according to the stories
      which I have heard, arranged to dine with her that night. She came to call
      for him and found that he had disappeared. According to his servant, he
      simply walked out in morning clothes, soon after six o&rsquo;clock, without
      leaving any message, and never returned. On the top of that, though, there
      followed, as I expect you have heard, some very insistent police enquiries
      as to Orden&rsquo;s doings on the night he spent with his friend Miles Furley.
      There is no doubt that a German submarine was close to Blakeney harbour
      that night and that a communication of some sort was landed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems absurd to connect Julian with any idea of treasonable
      communication with Germany,&rdquo; the Bishop said slowly. &ldquo;A more typical young
      Englishman of his class I never met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to a certain point I agree with you,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson confessed, &ldquo;but
      there are some further rumours to which I cannot allude, concerning
      Julian. Orden, which are, to say the least of it, surprising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men came to a standstill once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stenson laid his hand upon his companion&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;I know what is the matter with you, my friend. Your heart is too big. The
      cry of the widow and the children lingers too long in your ears. Remember
      some of your earlier sermons at the beginning of the war. Remember how
      wonderfully you spoke one morning at St. Paul&rsquo;s upon the spirituality to
      be developed by suffering, by sacrifice. &lsquo;The hand which chastises also
      purifies.&rsquo; Wasn&rsquo;t that what you said? You probably didn&rsquo;t know that I was
      one of your listeners, even&mdash;I myself, in those days, scarcely looked
      upon the war as I do now. I remember crawling in at the side door of the
      Cathedral and sitting unrecognised on a hard chair. It was a great
      congregation, and I was far away in the background, but I heard. I
      remember the rustle, too, the little moaning, indrawn breath of emotion
      when the people rose to their feet. Take heart, Bishop. I will remind you
      once more of your own words &lsquo;These are the days of purification.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men separated. The Bishop walked thoughtfully towards the Strand,
      his hands clasped behind his back, the echo of those quoted words of his
      still in his ear. As he came to the busy crossing, he raised his head and
      looked around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;my eyes have been closed. Perhaps there are
      things to be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called a taxicab and, giving the man some muttered directions, was
      driven slowly down the Strand, looking eagerly first on one side of the
      way and then on the other. It was approaching the luncheon hour and the
      streets were thronged. Here seemed to be the meeting place of the Colonial
      troops,&mdash;long, sinewy men, many of them, with bronzed faces and
      awkward gait. They elbowed their way along, side by side with the queerest
      collection of people in the world. They stopped and talked in little
      knots, they entered and left the public houses, stood about outside the
      restaurants. Here and there they walked arm in arm with women. Taxicabs
      were turning in at the Savoy, taxicabs and private cars. Young ladies of
      the stage, sometimes alone, very often escorted, were everywhere in
      evidence. The life of London was flowing on in very much the same
      channels. There were few, if any signs of that thing for which he sought.
      The taxicab turned westwards, crossed Piccadilly Circus and proceeded
      along Piccadilly, its solitary occupant still gazing into the faces of the
      people with that same consuming interest. It was all the same over again&mdash;the
      smiling throngs entering and leaving the restaurants, the smug
      promenaders, the stream of gaily dressed women and girls. Bond Street was
      even more crowded with shoppers and loiterers. The shop windows were as
      full as ever, the toilettes of the women as wonderful. Mankind, though
      khaki-clad, was plentiful. The narrow thoroughfare was so crowded that his
      taxicab went only at a snail&rsquo;s crawl, and occasionally he heard scraps of
      conversation. Two pretty girls were talking to two young men in uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a rag last night! I didn&rsquo;t get home till three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick never got home at all. Still missing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evie and I are worn out with shopping. Everything&rsquo;s twice as expensive,
      but one simply can&rsquo;t do without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t do without anything, these days. One never knows how long it
      may last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The taxicab moved on, and the Bishop&rsquo;s eyes for a moment were half-closed.
      The voices followed him, however. Two women, leading curled and pampered
      toy dogs, were talking at the corner of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sugar, my dear?&rdquo; one was saying. &ldquo;Why, I laid in nearly a hundredweight,
      and I can always get what I want now. The shopkeepers know that they have
      to have your custom after the war. It&rsquo;s only the people who can&rsquo;t afford
      to buy much at a time who are really inconvenienced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s awfully sad about the war, and all that, but one has to
      think of oneself. Harry told me last night that after paying all the
      income tax he couldn&rsquo;t get out of, and excess profits; he is still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voices dropped to a whisper. The Bishop thrust his head out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive me to Tothill Street, Westminster,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;As quickly as
      possible, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man turned up a side street and drove off. Still the Bishop watched,
      only by now the hopefulness had gone from his face. He had sought for
      something of which there had been no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismissed his taxicab in front of a large and newly finished block of
      buildings in the vicinity of Westminster. A lift man conducted him to the
      seventh floor, and a commissionaire ushered him into an already crowded
      waiting room. A youth, however, who had noticed the Bishop&rsquo;s entrance,
      took him in charge, and, conducting him through two other crowded rooms,
      knocked reverently at the door of an apartment at the far end of the
      suite. The door was opened, after a brief delay, by a young man of
      unpleasant appearance, who gazed suspiciously at the distinguished visitor
      through heavy spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bishop wishes to see Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; his guide announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in at once,&rdquo; a voice from the middle of the room directed. &ldquo;You
      can go and have your lunch, Johnson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop found himself alone with the man whom he had come to visit,&mdash;a
      moderately tall, thin figure, badly-dressed, with a drooping moustache,
      bright eyes and good forehead, but peevish expression. He stood up while
      he shook hands with the Bishop and motioned him to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First time you&rsquo;ve honoured us, Bishop,&rdquo; he remarked, with the air of one
      straining after an equality which he was far from feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt an unconquerable impulse to talk with you,&rdquo; the Bishop admitted.
      &ldquo;Tell me your news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything progresses,&rdquo; Nicholas Fenn declared confidently. &ldquo;The last
      eleven days have seen a social movement in this country, conducted with
      absolute secrecy, equivalent in its portentous issues to the greatest
      revolution of modern times. For the first time in history, Bishop, the
      united voice of the people has a chance of making itself heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; the Bishop said, &ldquo;you have accomplished a wonderful work. Now
      comes the moment when we must pause and think. We must be absolutely and
      entirely certain that the first time that voice is heard it is heard in a
      righteous cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a more righteous cause in the world than the cause of peace?&rdquo;
       Fenn asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if that peace be just and reasonable,&rdquo; the Bishop replied, &ldquo;not if
      that peace can bring to an end this horrible and bloody struggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see to that,&rdquo; Fenn declared, with a self-satisfied air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have by now, I suppose, the terms proposed by your&mdash;your kindred
      body in Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Fenn stroked his moustache. There was a frown upon his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect to have them at any moment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but to tell you the
      truth, at the present moment they are not available.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; the other interrupted. &ldquo;The document, however, was not where we
      expected to find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely that is a very serious complication?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will mean a certain delay if we don&rsquo;t succeed in getting hold of it,&rdquo;
       Fenn admitted. &ldquo;We intend to be firm about the matter, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop&rsquo;s expression was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian Orden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is my godson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessity knows neither friendship nor relationship,&rdquo; Fenn pronounced
      didactically. &ldquo;Better ask no questions, sir. These details do not concern
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They concern my conscience,&rdquo; was the grave reply. &ldquo;Ours is an earnest
      spiritual effort for peace, a taking away from the hands of the
      politicians of a great human question which they have proved themselves
      unable to handle. We should look, therefore, with peculiar care to the
      means we adopt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Fenn nodded. He lit a very pungent cigarette from a paper packet
      by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I, Bishop,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are pacifists in the broadest meaning of
      the word, but that does not mean that we may not sometimes have to use
      force to attain our object. We have a department which alone is concerned
      with the dealing of such matters. It is that department which has
      undertaken the forwarding and receipt of all communications between
      ourselves and our friends across the North Sea. Its operations are
      entirely secret, even from the rest of the Council. It will deal with
      Julian Orden. It is best for you not to interfere, or even to have
      cognisance of what is going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot agree,&rdquo; the Bishop protested. &ldquo;An act of unchristian violence
      would be a flaw in the whole superstructure which we are trying to build
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us discuss some other subject,&rdquo; Fenn proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; was the firm reply. &ldquo;I have come here to discuss this one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Fenn looked down at the table. His expression was not altogether
      pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your position with us, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;although much appreciated, does
      not warrant your interference in executive details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; the Bishop insisted, &ldquo;you must please treat me reasonably
      in this matter, Mr. Fenn. Remember I am not altogether extinct as a force
      amongst your followers. I have three mass meetings to address this week,
      and there is the sermon next Sunday at Westminster Abbey, at which it has
      been agreed that I shall strike the first note of warning. I am a helper,
      I believe, worth considering, and there is no man amongst you who risks
      what I risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what are you asking from me?&rdquo; Fenn demanded, after a moment&rsquo;s
      deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to know the whereabouts and condition of Julian Orden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is one which is being dealt with by our secret service
      department,&rdquo; Fenn replied, &ldquo;but I see no reason why I should not give you
      all reasonable information. The young man in question asked for trouble,
      and to a certain extent he has found it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; the Bishop reminded his companion, &ldquo;that he has very
      nearly, if not altogether, compromised himself in his efforts to shield
      Miss Abbeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be so,&rdquo; Fenn admitted, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t alter the fact that he
      refuses to return to her the packet which she entrusted to his care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is still obdurate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to now, absolutely so. Perhaps,&rdquo; Fenn added, with a slightly malicious
      smile, &ldquo;you would like to try what you can do with him yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian Orden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a young man of peculiarly stubborn type, but
      if I thought that my exhortations would be of any benefit, I would not
      shrink from trying them, whatever it might cost me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better have a try, then,&rdquo; Fenn suggested. &ldquo;If we do not succeed within
      the next twenty-four hours, I shall give you an order to see him. I don&rsquo;t
      mind confessing,&rdquo; he went on confidentially, &ldquo;that the need for the
      production of that document is urgent, apart from the risk we run of
      having our plans forestalled if it should fall into the hands of the
      Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume that Miss Abbeway has already done her best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has worn herself out with persuasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he himself been told the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your own knowledge of the young man, do you think that it would be
      of any use? Even Miss Abbeway is forced to admit that any one less likely
      to sympathise with our aims it would be impossible to find. At the same
      time, if we do arrange an interview for you, use any arguments you can
      think of. To tell you the truth, our whole calculations have been upset by
      not discovering the packet upon his person. He was on his way to Downing
      Street when our agents intervened, and we never doubted that he would have
      it with him. When will it be convenient for you to pay your visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any time you send for me,&rdquo; the Bishop replied. &ldquo;Meanwhile, Mr. Fenn,
      before I leave I want to remind you once more of the original purpose of
      my call upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn frowned a little peevishly as he rose to usher his visitor out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway has already extorted a foolish promise from us,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;The young man&rsquo;s safety for the present is not in question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop, more from custom than from any appetite, walked across the
      Park to the Athenaeum. Mr. Hannaway Wells accosted him in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a world of rumours,&rdquo; he remarked with a smile. &ldquo;I have just heard
      that Julian Orden, of all men in the world, has been shot as a German
      spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop smiled with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may take it from me,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;that the rumour is untrue.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nicholas Fenn, although civilisation had laid a heavy hand upon him during
      the last few years, was certainly not a man whose outward appearance
      denoted any advance in either culture or taste. His morning clothes,
      although he had recently abandoned the habit of dealing at a ready-made
      emporium, were neither well chosen nor well worn. His evening attire was,
      if possible, worse. He met Catherine that evening in the lobby of what he
      believed to be a fashionable grillroom, in a swallow-tailed coat, a badly
      fitting shirt with a single stud-hole, a black tie, a collar which
      encircled his neck like a clerical band, and ordinary walking boots. She
      repressed a little shiver as she shook hands and tried to remember that
      this was not only the man whom several millions of toilers had chosen to
      be their representative, but also the duly appointed secretary of the most
      momentous assemblage of human beings in the world&rsquo;s history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am not late,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I really do not care much about dining
      out, these days, but your message was so insistent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must have relaxation,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The weight of affairs all day
      long is a terrible strain. Shall we go in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the room and stood looking aimlessly about them, Fenn having,
      naturally enough, failed to realise the necessity of securing a table. A
      maitre d&rsquo;hotel, however, recognised Catherine and hastened to their
      rescue. She conversed with the man for a few minutes in French, while her
      companion listened admiringly, and finally, at his solicitation, herself
      ordered the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The news, please, Mr. Fenn?&rdquo; she asked, as soon as the man had withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s leave it alone for a time! One gets sick
      of shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows a little discouragingly. She was dressed with
      extraordinary simplicity, but the difference in caste between the two
      supplied a problem for many curious observers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we talk of trifles,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;when we both have such a
      great interest in the most wonderful subject in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the most wonderful subject in the world?&rdquo; he asked impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our cause, of course,&rdquo; she answered firmly, &ldquo;the cause of all the peoples&mdash;Peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One labours the whole day long for that,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;When the hour for
      rest comes, surely one may drop it for a time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel like that?&rdquo; she remarked indifferently. &ldquo;For myself, during
      these days I have but one thought. There is nothing else in my life. And
      you, with all those thousands and millions of your fellow creatures
      toiling, watching and waiting for a sign from you&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t
      imagine how your thoughts can ever wander from them for a moment, how you
      can ever remember that self even exists! I should like to be trusted, Mr.
      Fenn, as you are trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My work,&rdquo; he said complacently, &ldquo;has, I hope, justified that trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;and yet the greatest part of it is to come.
      Tell me about Mr. Orden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no change in the fellow&rsquo;s attitude. I don&rsquo;t imagine there will
      be until the last moment. He is just a pig-headed, insufferably conceited
      Englishman, full of class prejudices to his finger tips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is nevertheless a man,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I heard only yesterday
      that he earned considerable distinction even in his brief soldiering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; Fenn remarked, without enthusiasm, &ldquo;he has the bravery of an
      animal. By the bye, the Bishop dropped in to see me this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What did he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a personal call,&rdquo; was the elaborately careless reply. &ldquo;He likes to
      look in for a chat, now and then. He spoke about Orden, too. I persuaded
      him that if we don&rsquo;t succeed within the next twenty four hours, it will be
      his duty to see what he can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but that was too bad!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You know how he feels his
      position, poor man. He will simply loathe having to tell Julian&mdash;Mr.
      Orden, I mean that he is connected with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, with what, Miss Abbeway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With anything in the nature of a conspiracy. Of course, Mr. Orden
      wouldn&rsquo;t understand. How could he? I think it was cruel to bring the
      Bishop into the matter at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Fenn pronounced, &ldquo;is cruel that helps the cause. What will you
      drink, Miss Abbeway? You&rsquo;ll have some champagne, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a horrible idea!&rdquo; she exclaimed, smiling at him nevertheless. &ldquo;Fancy
      a great Labour leader suggesting such a thing! No, I&rsquo;ll have some light
      French wine, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn passed the order on to the waiter, a little crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often drink anything myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but this seemed to me to
      be something of an occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some news, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I meant dining with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;That is simply a matter of routine. I thought
      you had some news, or some work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it possible, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;that we might have some
      interests outside our work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; she answered, with an insolence which was above
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell me your tastes,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Are you fond of grand
      opera, for instance? I adore it. &lsquo;Parsifal&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;The Ring&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about music,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;My sister, who used to live
      with me, plays the piano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drop music, then,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;Books? But I remember you
      once told me that you had never read anything except detective novels, and
      that you didn&rsquo;t care for poetry. Sports? I adore tennis and I am rather
      good at golf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never wasted a single moment of my life in games,&rdquo; he declared
      proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, that leaves us rather a long way apart, outside our work,
      doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if I were prepared to admit that, which I am not,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;our
      work itself is surely enough to make up for all other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;There is nothing else worth
      thinking about, worth talking about. Tell me&mdash;you had an inner
      Council this afternoon&mdash;is anything decided yet about the
      leadership?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever there was a great cause in the world,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which stands
      some chance of missing complete success through senseless and low-minded
      jealousy, it is ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fenn!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;As you know, a chairman must be elected this
      week, and that chairman, of course, will hold more power in his hand than
      any emperor of the past or any sovereign of the present. That leader is
      going to stop the war. He is going to bring peace to the world. It is a
      mighty post, Miss Abbeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; she agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet would you believe,&rdquo; he went on, leaning across the table and
      neglecting for a moment his dinner, &ldquo;would you believe, Miss Abbeway, that
      out of the twenty representatives chosen from the Trades Unions governing
      the principal industries of Great Britain, there is not a single one who
      does not consider himself eligible for the post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine found herself suddenly laughing, while Fenn looked at her in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help it,&rdquo; she apologised. &ldquo;Please forgive me. Do not think that
      I am irreverent. It is not that at all. But for a moment the absurdity of
      the thing overcame me. I have met some of them, you know&mdash;Mr. Cross
      of Northumberland, Mr. Evans of South Wales&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evans is one of the worst,&rdquo; Fenn interrupted, with some excitement.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man who has only worn a collar for the last few years of his
      life, who evaded the board-school because he was a pitman&rsquo;s lad, who
      doesn&rsquo;t even know the names of the countries of Europe, but who still
      believes that he is a possible candidate. And Cross, too! Well, he washes
      when he comes to London, but he sleeps in his clothes and they look like
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very eloquent,&rdquo; Catherine observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloquent!&rdquo; Fenn exclaimed scornfully. &ldquo;He may be, but who can understand
      him? He speaks in broad Northumbrian. What is needed in the leader whom
      they are to elect this week, Miss Abbeway, is a man of some culture and
      some appearance. Remember that to him is to be confided the greatest task
      ever given to man. A certain amount of personality he must have&mdash;personality
      and dignity, I should say, to uphold the position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Mr. Miles Furley,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully. &ldquo;He is an educated
      man, is he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that very reason unsuitable,&rdquo; Fenn explained eagerly. &ldquo;He represents
      no great body of toilers. He is, in reality, only an honorary member of
      the Council, like yourself and the Bishop, there on account of his outside
      services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember, only a few nights ago,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;I was staying at a
      country house&mdash;Lord Maltenby&rsquo;s, by the bye&mdash;Mr. Orden&rsquo;s father.
      The Prime Minister was there and another Cabinet Minister. They spoke of
      the Labour Party and its leaderless state. They had no idea, of course, of
      the great Council which was already secretly formed, but they were
      unanimous about the necessity for a strong leader. Two people made the
      same remark, almost with apprehension: &lsquo;If ever Paul Fiske should
      materialise, the problem would be solved!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn assented without enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, though,&rdquo; he reminded her, &ldquo;a clever writer does not always
      make a great speaker, nor has he always that personality and distinction
      which is required in this case. He would come amongst us a stranger, too&mdash;a
      stranger personally, that is to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the broadest sense of the word,&rdquo; Catherine objected. &ldquo;Paul Fiske
      is more than an ordinary literary man. His heart is in tune with what he
      writes. Those are not merely eloquent words which he offers. There is a
      note of something above and beyond just phrase-making&mdash;a note of
      sympathetic understanding which amounts to genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion stroked his moustache for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiske goes right to the spot,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but the question of the
      leadership, so far as he is concerned, doesn&rsquo;t come into the sphere of
      practical politics. It has been suggested, Miss Abbeway, by one or two of
      the more influential delegates, suggested, too, by a vast number of
      letters and telegrams which have poured in upon us during the last few
      days, that I should be elected to this vacant post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; she exclaimed, a little blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you think of a more suitable person?&rdquo; he asked, with a faint note of
      truculence in his tone. &ldquo;You have seen us all together. I don&rsquo;t wish to
      flatter myself, but as regards education, service to the cause,
      familiarity with public speaking and the number of those I represent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! I see,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Taking the twenty Labour
      representatives only, Mr. Fenn, I can see nothing against your selection,
      but I fancied, somehow, that some one outside&mdash;the Bishop, for
      instance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely out of the question,&rdquo; Fenn declared. &ldquo;The people would lose
      faith in the whole thing in a minute. The person who throws down the gage
      to the Prime Minister must have the direct mandate of the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They finished dinner presently. Fenn looked with admiration at the gold,
      coroneted case from which Catherine helped herself to one of her tiny
      cigarettes. He himself lit an American cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had meant, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he confided, leaning towards her, &ldquo;to suggest
      a theatre to you to-night&mdash;in fact, I looked at some dress circle
      seats at the Gaiety with a view to purchasing. Another matter has cropped
      up, however. There is a little business for us to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business?&rdquo; Catherine repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He produced a folded paper from his pocket and passed it across the table.
      Catherine read it with a slight frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An order entitling the bearer to search Julian Orden&rsquo;s apartments!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to search them, do we? Besides, what authority
      have we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best,&rdquo; he answered, tapping with his discoloured forefinger the
      signature at the foot of the strip of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She examined it with a doubtful frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did this come into your possession?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her in superior fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By asking for it,&rdquo; he replied bluntly. &ldquo;And between you and me, Miss
      Abbeway, there isn&rsquo;t much we might ask for that they&rsquo;d care to refuse us
      just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the police have already searched Mr. Orden&rsquo;s rooms,&rdquo; she reminded
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police have been known to overlook things. Of course, what I am
      hoping is that amongst Mr. Orden&rsquo;s papers there may be some indication as
      to where he has deposited our property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this has nothing to do with me,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I do not like to be
      concerned in such affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I particularly wish you to accompany me,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;You are the only
      one who has seen the packet. It would be better, therefore, if we
      conducted the search in company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine made a little grimace, but she objected no further. She objected
      very strongly, however, when Fenn tried to take her arm on leaving the
      place, and she withdrew into her own corner of the taxi immediately they
      had taken their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forgive my prejudices, Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;my foreign
      bringing up, perhaps&mdash;but I hate being touched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; he remonstrated. &ldquo;No need to be so stand-offish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to hold her hand, an attempt which she skilfully frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she insisted earnestly, &ldquo;this sort of thing does not amuse me. I
      avoid it even amongst my own friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not a friend?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as regards our work, you certainly are,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Outside
      it, I do not think that we could ever have much to say to one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he objected, a little sharply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re as close together in our
      work and aims as any two people could be. Perhaps,&rdquo; he went on, after a
      moment&rsquo;s hesitation and a careful glance around, &ldquo;I ought to take you into
      my confidence as regards my personal position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not inviting anything of the sort,&rdquo; she observed, with faint but
      wasted sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me, of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;only as the late manager of a firm
      of timber merchants and the present elected representative of the allied
      Timber and Shipbuilding Trades Unions. What you do not know&rdquo;&mdash;a queer
      note of triumph stealing into his tone &ldquo;is that I am a wealthy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagined,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that all Labour leaders were like the
      Apostles&mdash;took no thought for such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must always keep one&rsquo;s eye on the main chance; Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he
      protested, &ldquo;or how would things be when one came to think of marriage, for
      instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did your money come from?&rdquo; she asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her question was framed simply to direct him from a repulsive subject. His
      embarrassment, however, afforded her food for future thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have saved money all my life,&rdquo; he confided eagerly. &ldquo;An uncle left me a
      little. Lately I have speculated&mdash;successfully. I don&rsquo;t want to dwell
      on this. I only wanted you to understand that if I chose I could cut a
      very different figure&mdash;that my wife wouldn&rsquo;t have to live in a
      suburb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really do not see,&rdquo; was the cold response, &ldquo;how this concerns me in the
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, call yourself a Socialist, don&rsquo;t you, Miss Abbeway?&rdquo; he demanded.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not allowing the fact that you&rsquo;re an aristocrat and that I am a
      self-made man to weigh with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accident of birth counts for nothing,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;you must know
      that those are my principles&mdash;but it sometimes happens that birth and
      environment give one tastes which it is impossible to ignore. Please do
      not let us pursue this conversation any further, Mr. Fenn. We have had a
      very pleasant dinner, for which I thank you&mdash;and here we are at Mr.
      Orden&rsquo;s flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion handed her out a little sulkily, and they ascended in the
      lift to the fifth floor. The door was opened to them by Julian&rsquo;s servant.
      He recognised Catherine and greeted her respectfully. Fenn produced his
      authority, which the man accepted without comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No news of your master yet?&rdquo; Catherine asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all, madam,&rdquo; was the somewhat depressed admission. &ldquo;I am afraid
      that something must have happened to him. He was not the kind of gentleman
      to go away like this and leave no word behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; she advised cheerfully, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t despair. More wonderful
      things have happened than that your master should return home to-morrow or
      the next day with a perfectly simple explanation of his absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very glad to see him, madam,&rdquo; the man replied, as he backed
      towards the door. &ldquo;If I can be of any assistance, perhaps you will ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The valet departed, closing the door behind him. Catherine looked around
      the room into which they had been ushered, with a little frown. It was
      essentially a man&rsquo;s sitting room, but it was well and tastefully
      furnished, and she was astonished at the immense number of books,
      pamphlets and Reviews which crowded the walls and every available space.
      The Derby desk still stood open, there was a typewriter on a special
      stand, and a pile of manuscript paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;could Mr. Orden have wanted with a
      typewriter! I thought journalism was generally done in the offices of a
      newspaper&mdash;the sort of journalism that he used to undertake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice little crib, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Fenn remarked, glancing around. &ldquo;Cosy little
      place, I call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in the man&rsquo;s expression as he advanced towards her brought all
      the iciness back to her tone and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pleasant apartment,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I am not at all sure that I
      like being here, and I certainly dislike our errand. It does not seem
      credible that, if the police have already searched, we should find the
      packet here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police don&rsquo;t know what to look for,&rdquo; he reminded her. &ldquo;We do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was apparently very little delicacy about Mr. Fenn. He drew a chair
      to the desk and began to look through a pile of papers, making running
      comments as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! Our friend seems to have been quite a collector of old books. I
      expect second-hand booksellers found him rather a mark. Some fellow here
      thanking him for a loan. And here&rsquo;s a tailor&rsquo;s bill. By Jove, Miss
      Abbeway, just listen to this! &lsquo;One dress suit-fourteen guineas!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
      the way these fellows who don&rsquo;t know any better chuck their money about,&rdquo;
       he added, swinging around in his chair towards her. &ldquo;The clothes I have on
      cost me exactly four pounds fifteen cash, and I guarantee his were no
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine frowned impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not come here, did we, Mr. Fenn, to discuss Mr. Orden&rsquo;s tailor&rsquo;s
      bill? I can see no object at all in going through his correspondence in
      this way. What you have to search for is a packet wrapped up in thin
      yellow oilskin, with &lsquo;Number 17&rsquo; on the outside in black ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he might have slipped it in anywhere,&rdquo; Fenn pointed out. &ldquo;Besides,
      there&rsquo;s always a chance that one of his letters may give us a clue as to
      where he has hidden the document. Come and sit down by the side of me,
      won&rsquo;t you, Miss Abbeway? Do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather stand, thank you,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You seem to find your
      present occupation to your taste. I should loathe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never think of my own feelings,&rdquo; Fenn said briskly, &ldquo;when there&rsquo;s a job
      to be done. I wish you&rsquo;d be a bit more friendly, though, Miss Abbeway. Let
      me pull that chair up by the side of mine. I like to have you near. You
      know, I&rsquo;ve been a bachelor for a good many years,&rdquo; he went on
      impressively, &ldquo;but a little homey place like this always makes me think of
      things. I&rsquo;ve nothing against marriage if only a man can be lucky enough to
      get the right sort of girl, and although advanced thinkers like you and me
      and some of the others are looking at things differently, nowadays, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind much which way it was,&rdquo; he confided, dropping his voice a
      little and laying his hand upon her arm, &ldquo;if you could make up your mind&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She snatched her arm away, and this time even he could not mistake the
      anger which blazed in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;why is it so difficult to make you understand?
      I detest such liberties as you are permitting yourself. And for the rest,
      my affections are already engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds a bit old-fashioned, that,&rdquo; he remarked, scowling a little. &ldquo;Of
      course, I don&rsquo;t expect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what you expect,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;Please go on with this
      search, if you are going to make one at all. The vulgarity of the whole
      thing annoys me, and I do not for a moment suppose that the packet is
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t on Orden,&rdquo; he reminded her sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must have sent it somewhere for safe keeping,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I
      had already given him cause to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he has, then amongst his correspondence there may be some indication
      as to where he sent it,&rdquo; Fenn pointed out, with unabated ill-temper. &ldquo;If
      you don&rsquo;t like the job, and you won&rsquo;t be friendly, you&rsquo;d better take the
      easy-chair and wait till I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, watching him with angry eyes, uncomfortable, unhappy,
      humiliated. She seemed to have dropped in a few hours from the realms of
      rarefied and splendid thought to a world of petty deeds. Not one of her
      companion&rsquo;s actions was lost upon her. She watched him study with
      ill-concealed reverence a ducal invitation, saw him read through without
      hesitation a letter which she felt sure was from Julian&rsquo;s mother. And
      then:
    </p>
    <p>
      The change in the man was so startling, his muttered exclamation&mdash;so
      natural that its profanity never even grated. His eyes seemed to be
      starting out of his head, his lips were drawn back from his teeth. Blank,
      unutterable surprise held him, dumb and spellbound, as he stared at a
      half-sheet of type written notepaper. She herself, amazed at his
      transformed appearance, found words for the moment impossible. Then a
      queer change came into his expression. His eyebrows drew closer together,
      his lips turned malevolently. He pushed the paper underneath a pile of
      others and turned his head towards her. Their eyes met. There was
      something like fear in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you have found?&rdquo; she cried breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;nothing of any importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose slowly to her feet and came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your partner in this hateful enterprise,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;Show me
      that paper which you have just concealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand on the lid of the desk, but she caught it and held it
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist upon seeing it,&rdquo; she said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and faced her. There was a most unpleasant light in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say that you shall not,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief, intense silence. Each seemed to be measuring the
      other&rsquo;s strength. Of the two, Catherine was the more composed. Fenn&rsquo;s face
      was still white and strained. His lips were twitching, his manner nervous
      and jerky. He made a desperate effort to reestablish ordinary relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t need to quarrel about this.
      That paper I came across has a special interest for me personally. I want
      to think about it before I say anything to a soul in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can consult with me,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;Our aims are the same. We are
      here for the same purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;I brought you here as my assistant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have the truth, then!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I brought you here to be
      alone with you, because I hoped that I might find you a little kinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you have been disappointed, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he answered, with unpleasant meaning in his tone, &ldquo;but we are
      not out of here yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot frighten me,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;Of course, you are a man&mdash;of
      a sort&mdash;and I am a woman, but I do not fancy that you would find, if
      it came to force, that you would have much of an advantage. However, we
      are wandering from the point. I claim an equal right with you to see
      anything which you may discover in Mr. Orden&rsquo;s papers. I might, indeed, if
      I chose, claim a prior right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; he answered, with an ugly scowl on his face. &ldquo;Mr. Julian Orden
      is by way of being a particular friend, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; Catherine told him, &ldquo;we are engaged to be married.
      It isn&rsquo;t a serious engagement. It was entered into by him in a most
      chivalrous manner, to save me from the consequences of a very clumsy
      attempt on my part to get back that packet. But there it is. Every one
      down at his home believes at the present moment that we are engaged and
      that I have come up to London to see our Ambassador.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are engaged,&rdquo; Fenn sneered, &ldquo;why hasn&rsquo;t he told you more of his
      secrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secrets!&rdquo; she repeated, a little scornfully. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think he has
      any. I should imagine his daily life could be investigated without the
      least fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d imagine wrong, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how interesting! You excite my curiosity. And must you continue to
      hold my wrist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me pull down the top of this desk, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to examine those papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a quick movement he gained a momentary advantage and shut the desk
      down. The key, however, disturbed by the jerk, fell on to the carpet, and
      Catherine possessed herself of it. She sprang lightly back from him and
      pressed the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n you, what are you going to do now?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come any nearer, or you may find that
      I can be unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and waited. She turned towards the servant who
      presently appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you telephone for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, madam,&rdquo; the man answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone to 1884 Westminster. Say that you are speaking for Miss
      Abbeway, and ask Mr. Furley, Mr. Cross, or whoever is there, to come at
      once to this address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, there&rsquo;s no sense in that,&rdquo; Fenn interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do as I ask, please, Robert?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed and left the room. Fenn strode sulkily back to the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;I give in. Give me the key, and I&rsquo;ll show
      you the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend to keep your word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out the key. He took it, opened the desk, searched amongst the
      little pile of papers, drew out the half-sheet of notepaper, and handed it
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;although if you are really engaged to marry Mr.
      Julian Orden,&rdquo; he added, with disagreeable emphasis, &ldquo;I am surprised that
      he should have kept such a secret from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ignored him and started to read the letter, glancing first at the
      address at the top. It was from the British Review, and was dated a few
      days back:
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Orden,
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it best to let you know, in case you haven&rsquo;t seen it yourself,
      that there is a reward of 100 pounds offered by some busybody for the name
      of the author of the &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo; articles. Your anonymity has been
      splendidly preserved up till now, but I feel compelled to warn you that a
      disclosure is imminent. Take my advice and accept it with a good grace.
      You have established yourself so irrevocably now that the value of your
      work will not be lessened by the discovery of the fact that you yourself
      do not belong to the class of whom you have written so brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to see you in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      M. HALKIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after she had concluded the letter, she still stared at it. She read
      again the one conclusive sentence&mdash;&ldquo;Your anonymity has been
      splendidly preserved up till now.&rdquo; Then she suddenly broke into a laugh
      which was almost hysterical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is his hack journalism!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Julian Orden&mdash;Paul
      Fiske!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you&rsquo;re surprised,&rdquo; Fenn observed. &ldquo;Fourteen guineas for a
      dress suit, and he thinks he understands the working man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head slowly and looked at him. There was a strange,
      repressed fire in her eyes. &ldquo;You are a very foolish person,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Your parents, I suppose, were small shopkeepers, or something of the
      sort, and you were brought up at a board-school and Julian Orden at Eton
      and Oxford, and yet he understands, and you do not. You see, heart counts,
      and sympathy, and the flair for understanding. I doubt whether these
      things are really found where you come from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught up his hat. His face was very white. His tone shook with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is our own fault,&rdquo; he exclaimed angrily, &ldquo;for having ever permitted
      an aristocrat to hold any place in our counsels! Before we move a step
      further, we&rsquo;ll purge them of such helpers as you and such false friends as
      Julian Orden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You very foolish person,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Stop, though. Why all this
      mystery? Why did you try to keep that letter from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conceived it to be for the benefit of our cause,&rdquo; he said didactically,
      &ldquo;that the anonymity&mdash;of &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo; should be preserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; she scoffed. &ldquo;You were afraid of him. Why, what fools we are!
      We will tell him the whole truth. We will tell him of our great scheme. We
      will tell him what we have been working for, these many months. The Bishop
      shall tell him, and you and I, and Miles Furley, and Cross. He shall hear
      all about it. He is with us! He must be with us! You shall put him on the
      Council. Why, there is your great difficulty solved,&rdquo; she went on, in
      growing excitement. &ldquo;There is not a working man in the country who would
      not rally under &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo;s&rsquo; banner. There you have your leader. It is
      he who shall deliver your ultimatum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if it is!&rdquo; Fenn declared, suddenly throwing his hat down and
      coming towards her furiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. Robert stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The message, madam,&rdquo; he began&mdash;and then stopped short. She crossed
      the room towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think I have found the way to bring your master
      back to you. Will you take me downstairs, please, and fetch me a taxi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, madam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked back from the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall telephone to Westminster in a few minutes, Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I hope I shall be in time to stop the others from coming. Perhaps you had
      better wait here, in case they have already started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply. To Catherine the world had become so wonderful that his
      existence scarcely counted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Catherine, notwithstanding her own excitement, found genuine pleasure in
      the bewildered enthusiasm with which the Bishop received her astounding
      news. She found him alone in the great, gloomy house which he usually
      inhabited when in London, at work in a dreary library to which she was
      admitted after a few minutes&rsquo; delay. Naturally, he received her tidings at
      first almost with incredulity. A heartfelt joy, however, followed upon
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always liked Julian,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I always believed that he had
      capacity. Dear me, though,&rdquo; he went on, with a whimsical little smile,
      &ldquo;what a blow for the Earl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the evening we all talked about the Labour question? Time
      seems to have moved so rapidly lately, but it was scarcely a week ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; the Bishop acknowledged. &ldquo;And, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he went
      on warmly, &ldquo;now indeed I feel that I can offer you congratulations which
      come from my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned a little away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;You would have known very soon, in any case&mdash;my
      engagement to Julian Orden was only a pretence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was desperate,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I felt I must have that packet back at
      any price. I went to his rooms to try and steal it. Well, I was found
      there. He invented our engagement to help me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you went off to London together, the neat day?&rdquo; the Bishop reminded
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all part of the game,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;What a fool he must have
      thought me! However, I am glad. I am riotously, madly glad. I am glad for
      the cause, I am glad for all our sakes. We have a great recruit, Bishop,
      the greatest we could have. And think! When he knows the truth, there will
      be no more trouble. He will hand us over the packet. We shall know just
      where we stand. We shall know at once whether we dare to strike the great
      blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was down at Westminster this afternoon,&rdquo; the Bishop told her. &ldquo;The
      whole mechanism of the Council of Labour seems to be complete. Twenty men
      control industrial England. They have absolute power. They are waiting
      only for the missing word. And fancy,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to-morrow I was to
      have visited Julian. I was to have used my persuasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must go to-night!&rdquo; Catherine exclaimed. &ldquo;There is no reason why we
      should waste a single second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be only too pleased,&rdquo; he assented gladly. &ldquo;Where is, he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine&rsquo;s face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were going to send some one with me tomorrow,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but in
      any case Fenn knows. We can get at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a little wry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I have disagreed with him. But
      that does not matter. Perhaps we had better go to the Council rooms. We
      shall find some of them there, and probably Fenn. I have a taxi waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove presently to Westminster. The ground floor of the great
      building, which was wholly occupied now by the offices of the different
      Labour men, was mostly in darkness, but on the top floor was a big room
      used as a club and restaurant, and also for informal meetings. Six or
      seven of the twenty-three were there, but not Fenn. Cross, a great brawny
      Northumbrian, was playing a game of chess with Furley. Others were writing
      letters. They all turned around at Catherine&rsquo;s entrance. She held out her
      hands to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great news, my friends!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Light up the committee room. I
      want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who were entitled to followed her into the room across the passage.
      One or two secretaries and a visitor remained outside. Six of them seated
      themselves at the long table&mdash;Phineas Cross, the Northumbrian pitman,
      Miles Furley, David Sands, representative of a million Yorkshire
      mill-hands, Thomas Evans, the South Wales miner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got a message from you, Miss Abbeway, a little time ago,&rdquo; Furley
      remarked. &ldquo;It was countermanded, though, just as we were ready to start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;I am sorry. I telephoned from Julian Orden&rsquo;s rooms.
      It was there we made the great discovery. Listen, all of you! I have
      discovered the identity of Paul Fiske.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little clamour of voices. The interest was indescribable. Paul
      Fiske was their cult, their master, their undeniable prophet. It was he
      who had set down in letters of fire the truths which had been struggling
      for imperfect expression in these men&rsquo;s minds. It was Paul Fiske who had
      fired them with enthusiasm for the cause which at first had been very much
      like a matter of bread and cheese to them. It was Paul Fiske who had
      formed their minds, who had put the great arguments into their brains, who
      had armed them from head to foot with potent reasonings. Four very
      ordinary men, of varying types, sincere men, all of plebeian extraction,
      all with their faults, yet all united in one purpose, were animated by
      that same fire of excitement. They hung over the table towards her. She
      might have been the croupier and they the gamblers who had thrown upon the
      table their last stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Julian Orden&rsquo;s rooms,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I found a letter from the editor of
      the British Review, warning him that his anonymity could not be preserved
      much longer&mdash;that before many weeks had passed the world would know
      that he was Paul Fiske. Here is the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed it around. They studied it, one by one. They were all a little
      stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian!&rdquo; Furley exclaimed, in blank amazement. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s been pulling my
      leg for more than a year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son of an Earl!&rdquo; Cross gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that. He is a democrat and honest to the backbone,&rdquo;
       Catherine declared. &ldquo;The Bishop will tell you so. He has known him all his
      life. Think! Julian Orden has no purpose to serve, no selfish interest to
      further. He has nothing to gain, everything to lose. If he were not
      sincere, if those words of his, which we all remember, did not come from
      his heart, where could be the excuse, the reason, for what he stands for?
      Think what it means to us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the man, isn&rsquo;t he,&rdquo; Sands asked mysteriously, &ldquo;whom they are
      looking after down yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where &lsquo;down yonder&rsquo; is,&rdquo; Catherine replied, &ldquo;but you have
      him in your power somewhere. He left his rooms last Thursday at about a
      quarter past six, to take that packet to the Foreign Office, or to make
      arrangements for its being received there. He never reached the Foreign
      Office. He hasn&rsquo;t been heard of since. Some of you know where he is. The
      Bishop and I want to go and find him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fenn and Bright know,&rdquo; Cross declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bright&rsquo;s job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is Bright in it?&rdquo; Catherine asked impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross frowned and puckered up his lips, an odd trick of his when he was
      displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bright represents the workers in chemical factories,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;They
      say that there isn&rsquo;t a poison in liquid, solid or gas form, that he
      doesn&rsquo;t know all about. Chap who gives me kind of shivers whenever he
      comes near. He and Fenn run the secret service branch of the Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he knows where Mr. Orden is, couldn&rsquo;t we send for him at once?&rdquo;
       Catherine suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Furley volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fenn and Bright are both out,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;and their rooms locked up.
      I rang up Fenn&rsquo;s house, but he hasn&rsquo;t been back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine stamped her foot. She was on fire with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem too bad!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If we could only get hold of
      Julian Orden to-night, if the Bishop and I could talk to him for five
      minutes, we could have this message for which we have been waiting so
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was suddenly opened. Fenn entered and received a little chorus of
      welcome. He was wearing a rough black overcoat over his evening clothes,
      and a black bowler hat. He advanced to the table with a little familiar
      swagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; the Bishop said, &ldquo;we have been awaiting your arrival
      anxiously. Tell us, please, where we can find Mr. Julian Orden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn gave vent to a half-choked, ironical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d asked me an hour ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should have told you to try
      Iris Villa, Acacia Road, Hampstead. I have just come from there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him?&rdquo; the Bishop enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I did not,&rdquo; Fenn replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Catherine demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he wasn&rsquo;t there, hasn&rsquo;t been since three o&rsquo;clock this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve moved him?&rdquo; Furley asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s moved himself,&rdquo; was the grim reply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s escaped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the brief, spellbound silence which followed his announcement, Fenn
      advanced slowly into the room. It chanced that during their informal
      discussion, the chair at the head of the table had been left unoccupied.
      The newcomer hesitated for a single second, then removed his hat, laid it
      on the floor by his side, and sank into the vacant seat. He glanced
      somewhat defiantly towards Catherine. He seemed to know quite well from
      whence the challenge of his words would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell us,&rdquo; Catherine said, mastering her emotion with an effort, &ldquo;that
      Julian Orden, whom we now know to be &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo;, has escaped. Just what
      do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can scarcely reduce my statement to plainer words,&rdquo; Fenn replied, &ldquo;but
      I will try. The danger in which we stood through the miscarriage of that
      packet was appreciated by every one of the Council. Discretionary powers
      were handed to the small secret service branch which is controlled by
      Bright and myself. Orden was prevented from reaching the Foreign Office
      and was rendered for a time incapable. The consideration of our further
      action with regard to him was to depend upon his attitude. Owing, no
      doubt, to some slight error in Bright&rsquo;s treatment. Orden has escaped from
      the place of safety in which he had been placed. He is now at large, and
      his story, together with the packet, will probably be in the hands of the
      Foreign Office some time to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giving them,&rdquo; Cross remarked grimly, &ldquo;the chance to get in the first blow&mdash;warrants
      for high treason, eh, against the twenty-three of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear that,&rdquo; Fenn asserted, &ldquo;not if we behave like sensible men.
      My proposal is that we anticipate, that one of us sees the Prime Minister
      to-morrow morning and lays the whole position before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without the terms,&rdquo; Furley observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know exactly what they will be,&rdquo; Fenn pointed out. &ldquo;The trouble, of
      course, is that the missing packet contains the signature of the three
      guarantors. The packet, no doubt, will be in the hands of the Foreign
      Office by to-morrow. The Prime Minister can verify our statements. We
      present our ultimatum a little sooner than we intended, but we get our
      blow in first and we are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop leaned forward in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me if I intervene for one moment,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;You say that
      Julian Orden has escaped. Are we to understand that he is absolutely at
      liberty and in a normal state of health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn hesitated for a single second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no reason to believe the contrary,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, it is possible,&rdquo; the Bishop persisted, &ldquo;that Julian Orden may not
      be in a position to forward that document to the Foreign Office for the
      present? If that is so, I am inclined to think that the Prime Minister
      would consider your visit a bluff. Certainly, you would have no argument
      weighty enough to induce him to propose the armistice. No man could act
      upon your word alone. He would want to see these wonderful proposals in
      writing, even if he were convinced of the justice of your arguments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little murmur of approval. Fenn leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drive me to a further disclosure,&rdquo; he declared, after a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation, &ldquo;one, perhaps, which I ought already to have made. I have
      arranged for a duplicate of that packet to be prepared and forwarded. I
      set this matter on foot the moment we heard from Miss Abbeway here of her
      mishap. The duplicate may reach us at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I propose,&rdquo; the Bishop said, &ldquo;that we postpone our decision until
      those papers be received. Remember that up to the present moment the
      Council have not pledged themselves to take action until they have perused
      that document.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And supposing,&rdquo; Fenn objected, &ldquo;that to-morrow morning at eight o&rsquo;clock,
      twenty-three of us are marched off to the Tower! Our whole cause may be
      paralysed, all that we have worked for all these months will be in vain,
      and this accursed and bloody war may be dragged on until our politicians
      see fit to make a peace of words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Mr. Stenson well,&rdquo; the Bishop declared, &ldquo;and I am perfectly
      convinced that he is too sane-minded a man to dream of taking such a step
      as you suggest. He, at any rate, if others in his Cabinet are not so
      prescient, knows what Labour means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with the Bishop, for many reasons,&rdquo; Furley pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Cross echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of the meeting was obvious. Fenn&rsquo;s unpleasant looking teeth
      flashed for a moment, and his mouth came together with a little snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is entirely an informal gathering,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall summon the
      Council to come together tomorrow at midday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we may sleep in our beds to-night without fear of
      molestation,&rdquo; the Bishop remarked, &ldquo;although if it had been the wish of
      the meeting, I would have broached the matter to Mr. Stenson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an honorary member of the Council,&rdquo; Fenn declared rudely. &ldquo;We
      don&rsquo;t wish interference. This is a national and international Labour
      movement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a member of the Labour Party of Christ,&rdquo; the Bishop said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And an honoured member of this Executive Council,&rdquo; Cross intervened.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit too glib with your tongue to-night, Fenn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of those whom I represent,&rdquo; was the curt reply. &ldquo;They are
      toilers, and they want the toilers to show their power. They don&rsquo;t want
      help from the Church. I&rsquo;ll go even so far,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as to say that they
      don&rsquo;t want help from literature. It&rsquo;s their own job. They&rsquo;ve begun it, and
      they want to finish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s meeting,&rdquo; Furley observed, &ldquo;will show how far you are right
      in your views. I consider my position, and the Bishop&rsquo;s, as members of the
      Labour Party, on a par with your own. I will go further and say that the
      very soul of our Council is embodied in the teachings and the writings of
      Paul Fiske, or, as we now know him to be, Julian Orden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn rose to his feet. He was trembling with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This informal meeting is adjourned,&rdquo; he announced harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross himself did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adjourned or not it may be, Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no place of
      yours to speak for it. You&rsquo;ve thrust yourself into that chair, but that
      don&rsquo;t make you chairman, now or at any other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn choked down the words which had seemed to tremble on his lips. His
      enemies he knew, but there were others here who might yet be neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have assumed more than I should have done, I am sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      brought you news which I was in a hurry to deliver. The rest followed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little company rose to their feet and moved towards the door,
      exchanging whispered comments concerning the news which Catherine had
      brought. She herself crossed the room and confronted Fenn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is still something to be said about that news,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fenn&rsquo;s attempt at complete candour was only partially convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not the slightest reason,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;why anything concerning
      Julian Orden should be concealed from any member of the Council who
      desires information. If you will follow me into my private room, Miss
      Abbeway, and you, Furley, I shall be glad to tell you our exact position.
      And if the Bishop will accompany you,&rdquo; he added, turning to the latter, &ldquo;I
      shall be honoured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furley made no reply, but, whispering something in Catherine&rsquo;s ear, took
      up his hat and left the room. The other two, however, took Fenn at his
      word, followed him into his room, accepted the chairs which he placed for
      them, and waited while he spoke through a telephone to the private
      exchange situated in the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; he announced, as he laid down the instrument, &ldquo;that Bright
      has this moment returned and is now on his way upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Bright that awful-looking person who came to the last Council
      meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is probably the person you mean,&rdquo; Fenn assented. &ldquo;He takes very little
      interest in our executive work, but he is one of the most brilliant
      scientists of this or any other generation. The Government has already
      given him three laboratories for his experiments, and nearly every gas
      that is being used at the Front has been prepared according to his
      formula.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A master of horrors,&rdquo; the Bishop murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks it,&rdquo; Catherine whispered under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door, a moment or two later, and Bright entered.
      He was a little over medium height, with long and lanky figure, a
      pronounced stoop, and black, curly hair of coarse quality. His head, which
      was thrust a little forward, perhaps owing to his short-sightedness, was
      long, his forehead narrow, his complexion a sort of olive-green. He wore
      huge, disfiguring spectacles, and he had the protuberant lips of a negro.
      He greeted Catherine and the Bishop absently and seemed to have a
      grievance against Fenn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want, Nicholas?&rdquo; he asked impatiently. &ldquo;I have some
      experiments going on in the country and can only spare a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Council has rescinded its instructions with regard to Julian Orden,&rdquo;
       Fenn announced, &ldquo;and is anxious to have him brought before them at once.
      As you know, we are for the moment powerless in the matter. Will you
      please explain to Miss Abbeway and the Bishop here just what has been
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a waste of time,&rdquo; Bright replied ill-naturedly, &ldquo;but here is the
      story. Julian Orden left his rooms at a quarter to six on Thursday
      evening. He walked down to St. James&rsquo;s Street and turned into the Park.
      Just as he passed the side door of Marlborough House he was attacked by a
      sudden faintness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which, I suppose,&rdquo; the Bishop interrupted, &ldquo;you were responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I or my deputy,&rdquo; Bright replied. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter which. He was
      fortunate enough to be able to hail a passing taxicab and was driven to my
      house in Hampstead. He has spent the intervening period, until three
      o&rsquo;clock this afternoon, in a small laboratory attached to the premises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A compulsory stay, I presume?&rdquo; the Bishop ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A compulsory stay, arranged for under instructions from the Council,&rdquo;
       Bright assented, in his hard, rasping voice. &ldquo;He has been most of the time
      under the influence of some new form of anaesthetic gas with which I have
      been experimenting. To-night, however, I must have made a mistake in my
      calculations. Instead of remaining in a state of coma until midnight, he
      recovered during my absence and appears to have walked out of the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea where he is at the present moment, then?&rdquo; Catherine
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the slightest,&rdquo; Bright assured her. &ldquo;I only know that he left the
      place without hat, gloves, or walking stick. Otherwise, he was fully
      dressed, and no doubt had plenty of money in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he likely to have any return of the indisposition from which, owing to
      your efforts, he has been suffering?&rdquo; the Bishop enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; was the curt answer. &ldquo;He may find his memory somewhat
      affected temporarily. He ought to be able to find his way home, though. If
      not, I suppose you&rsquo;ll hear of him through the police courts or a hospital.
      Nothing that we have done,&rdquo; he added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;is likely
      to affect his health permanently in the slightest degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You now know all that there is to be known, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; Fenn said. &ldquo;I
      agree with you that it is highly desirable that Mr. Orden should be found
      at once, and if you can suggest any way in which I might be of assistance
      in discovering his present whereabouts, I shall be only too glad to help.
      For instance, would you like me to telephone to his rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that we will trouble you.
      Mr. Furley is making enquiries both at Mr. Orden&rsquo;s rooms and at his
      clubs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perfectly satisfied, so far as I am concerned, I trust?&rdquo; he
      persisted, as he opened the door for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly satisfied,&rdquo; Catherine replied, looking him in the face, &ldquo;that
      you have told us as much as you choose to for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn closed the door behind Catherine and the Bishop and turned back into
      the room. Bright laughed at him unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love affair not going so strong, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn threw himself into his chair, took a cigarette from a paper packet,
      and lit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast Julian Orden!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No objection,&rdquo; his friend yawned. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard the news? It seems he&rsquo;s the fellow who has been writing
      those articles on Socialism and Labour, signing them &lsquo;Paul Fiske.&rsquo; 
      Idealistic rubbish, but of course the Bishop and his lot are raving about
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read some of his stuff,&rdquo; Bright admitted, himself lighting a
      cigarette; &ldquo;good in its way, but old-fashioned. I&rsquo;m out for something a
      little more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick to the point,&rdquo; Fenn enjoined morosely. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;ve found out who
      Julian Orden is, they want him produced. They want to elect him on the
      Council, make him chairman over all our heads, let him reap the reward of
      the scheme which our brains have conceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want him, eh? That&rsquo;s awkward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awkward for us,&rdquo; Fenn muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;d better have him, I suppose,&rdquo; Bright said, with slow and evil
      emphasis. &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;d better have him. We&rsquo;ll take off our hats, and
      assure him that it was a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late. I&rsquo;ve told Miss Abbeway and the Bishop that he is at large. You
      backed me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bright thrust his long, unpleasant, knobby fingers into his pocket, and
      produced a crumpled cigarette, which he lit from the end of his
      companion&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to the conclusion,&rdquo; Fenn decided, &ldquo;that it is not in the
      interests of our cause that Orden should become associated with it in any
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a good deal of power,&rdquo; Bright ruminated, &ldquo;but it seems to me you&rsquo;re
      inclined to stretch it. I gather that the others want him delivered up. We
      can&rsquo;t act against them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if they know,&rdquo; Fenn answered significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bright came over to the mantelpiece, leaned his elbow upon it, and hung
      his extraordinarily unattractive face down towards his companion&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for fencing, but I like plain
      words. You&rsquo;ve done well out of this new Party. I haven&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ve no hobby
      except saving your money. I have. My last two experiments, notwithstanding
      the Government allowance, have left me drained. I need money as you others
      need bread. I can live without food or drink, but I can&rsquo;t be without the
      means to keep my laboratories going. Do you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Fenn assented, taking up his hat. &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll drive towards
      Bermondsey with you. We&rsquo;ll talk on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Julian raised himself slightly from his recumbent position at the sound of
      the opening of the door. He watched Fenn with dull, incurious eyes as the
      latter crossed the uncarpeted floor of the bare wooden shed, threw off his
      overcoat, and advanced towards the side of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit up a little,&rdquo; the newcomer directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No strength,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;If I had, I should wring your damned neck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn looked down at him for a moment in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take this thing very hardly, Mr. Orden,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think that you
      had better give up this obstinacy. Your friends are getting anxious about
      you. For many reasons it would be better for you to reappear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be a little anxiety on the part of your friends about you,&rdquo;
       Julian retorted grimly, &ldquo;if ever I do get out of this accursed place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bear malice, I fear, Mr. Orden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian made no reply. His eyes were fixed upon the door. He turned away
      with a shudder. Bright had entered. In his hand he was carrying two gas
      masks. He came over to the side of the couch, and, looking down at Julian,
      lifted his hand, and felt his pulse. Then, with an abrupt movement, he
      handed one of the masks to Fenn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for yourself,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;I am going to give him an antidote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bright stepped back and adjusted his own gas mask, while Fenn followed
      suit. Then the former drew from his pocket what seemed to be a small tube
      with perforated holes at the top. He leaned over Julian and pressed it. A
      little cloud of faint mist rushed through the holes; a queer, aromatic
      perfume, growing stronger every moment, seemed to creep into the farthest
      corners of the room. In less than ten seconds Julian opened his eyes. In
      half a minute he was sitting up. His eyes were bright once more, there was
      colour in his cheeks. Bright spoke to him warningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Orden,&rdquo; he enjoined, &ldquo;sit where you are. Remember I have the other
      tube in my left hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infernal scoundrel!&rdquo; Julian exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bright,&rdquo; Fenn asserted, &ldquo;is nothing of the sort. Neither am I. We are
      both honest men faced with a colossal situation. There is nothing personal
      in our treatment of you. We have no enmity towards you. You are simply a
      person who has committed a theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What puzzles me,&rdquo; Julian muttered, &ldquo;is what you expect I am going to do
      about you, if ever I do escape from your clutches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do escape,&rdquo; Fenn said quietly, &ldquo;you will view the matter
      differently. You will find, as a matter of fact, that you are powerless to
      do anything. You will find a new law and a new order prevailing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;German law!&rdquo; Julian sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misjudge us,&rdquo; Fenn continued. &ldquo;Both Bright and I are patriotic
      Englishmen. We are engaged at the present moment in a desperate effort to
      save our country. You are the man who stands in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;that I should smile in this place, but
      you are beginning to amuse me. Why not be more explicit? Why not prove
      what you say? I might become amenable. I suppose your way of saving the
      country is to hand it over to the Germans, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our way of saving the country,&rdquo; Fenn declared, &ldquo;is to establish peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a little about you, Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know the sort of peace
      you would establish, the sort of peace any man would propose who conducts
      a secret correspondence with Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn, who had lifted his mask for a moment, slowly rearranged it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Orden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are not going to waste words upon you. You are
      hopelessly and intolerably prejudiced. Will you tell us where you have
      concealed the packet you intercepted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you almost tired of asking me that question? I&rsquo;m tired of hearing
      it,&rdquo; Julian replied. &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me try to prove to you,&rdquo; Fenn begged, &ldquo;that by the retention
      of that packet you are doing your country an evil service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you talked till doomsday,&rdquo; Julian assured him, &ldquo;I should not believe a
      word you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Fenn began slowly, with an evil glitter in his eyes!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for heaven&rsquo;s sake finish the thing this time!&rdquo; Julian interrupted.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of playing the laboratory rabbit for you. If you are out for
      murder, finish the job and have done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bright was playing with another tube which he had withdrawn from his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my duty to warn you, Mr. Orden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the contents of
      this little tube of gas, which will reach you with a touch of my fingers,
      may possibly be fatal and will certainly incapacitate you for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why warn me?&rdquo; Julian scoffed. &ldquo;You know very well that I haven&rsquo;t the
      strength of a cat, or I should wring your neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We feel ourselves,&rdquo; Bright continued unctuously, &ldquo;justified in using this
      tube, because its first results will be to throw you into a delirium, in
      the course of which we trust that you will divulge the hiding place of the
      stolen packet. We use this means in the interests of the country, and such
      risk as there may be lies on your own head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a canting hypocrite!&rdquo; Julian declared. &ldquo;Try your delirium. That
      packet happens to be in the one place where neither you nor one of your
      tribe could get at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a serious moment, this, Mr. Orden,&rdquo; Fenn reminded him. &ldquo;You are in
      the prime of life, and there is a scandal connected with your present
      position which your permanent disappearance would certainly not dissipate.
      Remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short. A whistle in the corner of the room was blowing. Bright
      moved towards it, but at that moment there was the sound of flying
      footsteps on the wooden stairs outside, and the door was flung open.
      Catherine, breathless with haste, paused for a moment on the threshold,
      then came forward with a little cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her, speechless, but with a sudden light in his eyes. She came
      across the room and dropped on her knees by his couch. The two men fell
      back. Fenn slipped back between her and the door. They both removed their
      masks, but they held them ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how dared they!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;The beasts! Tell me, are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weak as a kitten,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve poisoned me with their beastly
      gases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine rose to her feet. She faced the two men, her eyes flashing with
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Council will require an explanation of this, Mr. Fenn!&rdquo; she declared
      passionately. &ldquo;Barely an hour ago you told us that Mr. Orden had escaped
      from Hampstead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian Orden,&rdquo; Fenn replied, &ldquo;has been handed over to our secret service
      by the unanimous vote of the Council. We have absolute liberty to deal
      with him as we think fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you liberty to tell lies as to his whereabouts?&rdquo; Catherine demanded.
      &ldquo;You deliberately told the Council he had escaped, yet, entirely owing to
      Mr. Furley, I find you down here at Bermondsey with him. What were you
      going to do with him when I came in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Persuade him to restore the packet, if we could,&rdquo; Fenn answered sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Catherine retorted. &ldquo;You know very well that he is our friend.
      You have only to tell him the truth, and your task with him is at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; Julian muttered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine that I have any sympathy with
      your little nest of conspirators.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is only because you do not understand,&rdquo; Catherine assured him.
      &ldquo;Listen, and you shall hear the whole truth. I will tell you what is
      inside that packet and whose signatures you will find there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian gripped her wrist suddenly. His eyes were filled with a new fear.
      He was watching the two men, who were whispering together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; he exclaimed warningly, &ldquo;look out! These men mean mischief.
      That devil Bright invents a new poisonous gas every day. Look at Fenn
      buckling on his mask. Quick! Get out if you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine&rsquo;s hand touched her bosom. Bright sprang towards her, but he was
      too late. She raised a little gold whistle to her lips, and its pealing
      summons rang through the room. Fenn dropped his mask and glanced towards
      Bright. His face was livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s outside?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bishop and Mr. Furley. Great though my confidence is in you both, I
      scarcely ventured to come here alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The approaching footsteps were plainly audible. Fenn shrugged his
      shoulders with a desperate attempt at carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is in your mind, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can
      scarcely believe that you, at any rate, were in danger at our hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not trust you a yard,&rdquo; she replied fiercely. &ldquo;In any case, it is
      better that the others should come. Mr. Orden might not believe me. He
      will at least believe the Bishop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe whom?&rdquo; Julian demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened. The Bishop and Miles Furley came hastily in.
      Catherine stepped forward to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was obliged to whistle,&rdquo; she explained, a little hysterically. &ldquo;I do
      not trust either of these men. That fiend Bright has a poisonous gas with
      him in a pocket cylinder. I am convinced that they meant to murder
      Julian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two newcomers turned towards the couch and exchanged amazed greetings
      with Julian. Fenn threw his mask on to the table with an uneasy laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;is inclined to be melodramatic. The gas
      which Bright has in that cylinder is simply one which would produce a
      little temporary unconsciousness. We might have used it&mdash;we may still
      use it&mdash;but if you others are able to persuade Mr. Orden to restore
      the packet, our task with him is at an end. We are not his gaolers&mdash;or
      perhaps he would say his torturers&mdash;for pleasure. The Council has
      ordered that we should extort from him the papers you know of and has
      given us carte blanche as to the means. If you others can persuade him to
      restore them peaceably, why, do it. We are prepared to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian was still staring from one to the other of his visitors. His
      expression of blank astonishment had scarcely decreased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;unless you want to see me go insane before
      your eyes, please explain. It can&rsquo;t be possible that you have anything in
      common with this nest of conspirators.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop smiled a little wanly. He laid his hand upon his godson&rsquo;s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, I have been no party to your incarceration, Julian,&rdquo;, he
      declared, &ldquo;but if you will listen to me, I will tell you why I think it
      would be better for you to restore that packet to Miss Abbeway:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell that blackguard to give me another sniff of his restorative gas,&rdquo;
       Julian begged. &ldquo;These shocks are almost too much for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop turned interrogatively towards Bright, who once more leaned
      over Julian with the tube in his hand. Again the little mist, the pungent
      odour. Julian rose to his feet and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; began the Bishop earnestly, as he seated himself at the
      end of the couch on which Julian had been lying, &ldquo;let me try to remove
      some of your misconceptions. Miss Abbeway is in no sense of the word a
      German spy. She and I, Mr. Furley here, Mr. Fenn and Mr. Bright, all
      belong to an organisation leagued together for one purpose&mdash;we are
      determined to end the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pacifists!&rdquo; Julian muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idle word,&rdquo; the Bishop protested, &ldquo;because at heart we are all
      pacifists. There is not one of us who would wilfully choose war instead of
      peace. The only question is the price we are prepared to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not leave that to the Government?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Government,&rdquo; the Bishop replied, &ldquo;are the agents of the people. The
      people in this case wish to deal direct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again why?&rdquo; Julian demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the Government is composed wholly of politicians, politicians
      who, in far too many speeches, have pledged themselves to too many
      definite things. Still, the Government will have its chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain to me,&rdquo; Julian asked, &ldquo;why, if you are a patriotic society, you
      are in secret and illegal communication with Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Germany with whom we are in communication,&rdquo; the Bishop assured his
      questioner, &ldquo;is the Germany who thinks as we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are on a wild-goose chase,&rdquo; Julian declared, &ldquo;because the
      Germans who think as you do are in a hopeless minority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop&rsquo;s forefinger was thrust out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have you, Julian,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That very belief which you have just
      expressed is our justification, because it is the common belief throughout
      the country. I can prove to you that you are mistaken&mdash;can prove it,
      with the help of that very packet which is responsible for your
      incarceration here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; Julian begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That packet,&rdquo; the Bishop declared, &ldquo;contains the peace terms formulated
      by the Socialist and Labour parties of Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth precisely the paper it is written on?&rdquo; Julian scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ratified,&rdquo; the Bishop continued emphatically, &ldquo;by the three great men
      of Germany, whose signatures are attached to that document&mdash;the
      Kaiser, the Chancellor and Hindenburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian was electrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you seriously mean,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that those signatures are attached to
      proposals of peace formulated by the Socialist and Labour parties of
      Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed,&rdquo; was the confident reply. &ldquo;If the terms are not what we have
      been led to expect, or if the signatures are not there, the whole affair
      is at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are telling me wonderful things, sir,&rdquo; Julian confessed, after a
      brief pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am telling what you will discover yourself to be the truth,&rdquo; the Bishop
      insisted. &ldquo;And, Julian, I am appealing to you not only for the return of
      that packet, but for your sympathy, your help, your partisanship. You can
      guess now what has happened. Your anonymity has come to an end. The newly
      formed Council of Labour, to which we all belong, is eager and anxious to
      welcome you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one given me away?&rdquo; Julian asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth was discovered this evening, when your rooms were searched,&rdquo;
       she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the constitution of this Council of Labour?&rdquo; Julian enquired, a
      little dazed by this revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the very body of men which you yourself foreshadowed,&rdquo; the Bishop
      replied eagerly. &ldquo;Twenty of the members are elected by the Trades Unions
      and represent the great industries of the Empire; and there are three
      outsiders&mdash;Miss Abbeway, Miles Furley and myself. If you, Julian, had
      not been so successful in concealing your identity, you would have been
      the first man to whom the Council would have turned for help. Now that the
      truth is known, your duty is clear. The glory of ending this war will
      belong to the people, and it is partly owing to you that the people have
      grown to realise their strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own position at the present moment,&rdquo; Julian began, a little
      grimly!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no one to blame for that but yourself,&rdquo; Catherine interrupted.
      &ldquo;If we had known who you were, do you suppose that we should have allowed
      these men to deal with you in such a manner? Do you suppose that I should
      not have told you the truth about that packet? However, that is over. You
      know the truth now. We five are all members of the Council who are sitting
      practically night and day, waiting&mdash;you know what for. Do not keep us
      in suspense any longer than you can help. Tell us where to find this
      letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian passed his hand over his forehead a little wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am confused,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I must think. After all, you are engaged in
      a conspiracy. Stenson&rsquo;s Cabinet may not be the strongest on earth, or the
      most capable, but Stenson himself has carried the burden of this war
      bravely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the terms offered,&rdquo; the Bishop pointed out, &ldquo;are anything like what we
      expect, they are better than any which the politicians could ever have
      mooted, even after years more of bloodshed. It is my opinion that Stenson
      will welcome them, and that the country, generally speaking, will be
      entirely in favour of their acceptance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; Julian asked, &ldquo;that you think them reasonable, that you make
      your demand to the Prime Minister, and he refuses. What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; Fenn intervened, with the officious air of one who has been left
      out of the conversation far too long, &ldquo;is where we come in. At our word,
      every coal pit in England would cease work, every furnace fire would go
      out, every factory would stand empty. The trains would remain on their
      sidings, or wherever they might chance to be when the edict was
      pronounced. The same with the &lsquo;buses and cabs, the same with the
      Underground. Not a ship would leave any port in the United Kingdom, not a
      ship would be docked. Forty-eight hours of this would do more harm than a
      year&rsquo;s civil war. Forty-eight hours must procure from the Prime Minister
      absolute submission to our demands. Ours is the greatest power the world
      has ever evolved. We shall use it for the greatest cause the world has
      ever known&mdash;the cause of peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, in a way, was inevitable,&rdquo; Julian observed. &ldquo;You remember the
      conversation, Bishop,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;down at Maltenby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well indeed,&rdquo; the latter acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country went into slavery,&rdquo; Julian pronounced, &ldquo;in August, 1915. That
      slavery may or may not be good for them. To be frank, I think it depends
      entirely upon the constitution of your Council. It is so much to the good,
      Bishop, that you are there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Council, such as it is,&rdquo; Fenn remarked acidly, &ldquo;consists of men
      elected to their position by the votes of a good many millions of their
      fellow toilers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people may have chosen wisely,&rdquo; was the grave reply, &ldquo;or they may
      have made mistakes. Such things have been known. By the bye, I suppose
      that my durance is at an end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at an end, whichever way you decide,&rdquo; Catherine declared. &ldquo;Now that
      you know everything, though, you will not hesitate to give up the packet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;I will give it back into your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner the better!&rdquo; Fenn exclaimed eagerly. &ldquo;And, Mr. Orden, one
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian was standing amongst them now, very drawn and pale in the dim halo
      of light thrown down from the hanging lamp. His answering monosyllable was
      cold and restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you will understand,&rdquo; Fenn continued, &ldquo;that Bright and I were
      simply carrying out orders. To us you were an enemy. You had betrayed the
      trust of one of our members. The prompt delivery of that packet meant the
      salvation of thousands of lives. It meant a cessation of this ghastly
      world tragedy. We were harsh, perhaps, but we acted according to orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian glanced at the hand which Fenn had half extended but made no
      movement to take it. He leaned a little upon the Bishop&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me out of this place, sir, will you?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;As for Fenn and
      that other brute, what I have to say about them will keep.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a little more than half an hour later when Julian ascended the
      steps of his club in Pall Mall and asked the hall porter for letters.
      Except that he was a little paler than usual and was leaning more heavily
      upon his stick, there was nothing about his appearance to denote several
      days of intense strain. There was a shade of curiosity, mingled with
      surprise, in the commissionaire&rsquo;s respectful greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There have been a good many enquiries for you the last few days, sir,&rdquo; he
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; Julian replied. &ldquo;I was obliged to go out of town
      unexpectedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran through the little pile of letters and selected a bulky envelope
      addressed to himself in his own handwriting. With this he returned to the
      taxicab in which the Bishop and Catherine were seated. They gazed with
      fascinated eyes at the packet which he was carrying and which he at once
      displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he remarked, as he leaned back, &ldquo;there is nothing so
      impenetrable in the world as a club of good standing. It beats combination
      safes hollow. It would have taken all Scotland Yard to have dragged this
      letter from the rack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is really&mdash;it?&rdquo; Catherine demanded breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the packet,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;which you handed to me for safe
      keeping at Maltenby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove almost in silence to the Bishop&rsquo;s house, where it had been
      arranged that Julian should spend the night. The Bishop left the two
      together before the fire in his library, while he personally superintended
      the arrangement of a guest room. Catherine came over and knelt by the side
      of Julian&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I beg forgiveness for the past,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;or may I not talk
      of the future, the glorious future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it to be glorious?&rdquo; he asked a little doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be made so,&rdquo; she answered with fervour, &ldquo;by you more than by
      anybody else living. I defy you&mdash;you, Paul Fiske&mdash;to impugn our
      scheme, our aims, the goal towards which we strive. All that we needed was
      a leader who could lift us up above the localness, the narrow visions of
      these men. They are in deadly earnest, but they can&rsquo;t see far enough, and
      each sees along his own groove. It is true that at the end the same sun
      shines, but no assembly of people can move together along a dozen
      different ways and keep the same goal in view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched the packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not yet know the written word here,&rdquo; he reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;My heart tells me. Besides, I have had many hints.
      There are people in London whose position forces them to remain silent,
      who understand and know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foreigners?&rdquo; Julian asked suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neutrals, of course, but neutrals of discretion are very useful people.
      The military party in Germany is making a brave show still, but it is
      beaten, notwithstanding its victories. The people are gathering together
      in their millions. Their voice is already being heard. Here we have the
      proof of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even if these proposed terms are as favourable as you say,&rdquo; Julian
      objected, &ldquo;how can you force them upon the English Cabinet? There is
      America-France. Yours is purely a home demand. A government has other
      things to think of and consider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;France is war-weary to the bone,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;France will follow
      England, especially when she knows the contents of that packet. As for
      America, she came into this after the great sacrifices had been made. She
      demands nothing more than is to be yielded up. It is not for the sake of
      visionary ideas, not for diplomatic precedence that the humanitarians of
      the world are going to hesitate about ending this brutal slaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He studied her curiously. In the firelight her face seemed to him almost
      strangely beautiful. She was uplifted by the fervour of her thoughts. The
      depth in her soft brown eyes was immeasurable; the quiver of her lips, so
      soft and yet so spiritual, was almost inspiring. Her hand was resting upon
      his shoulder. She seemed to dwell upon his expression, to listen eagerly
      for his words. Yet he realised that in all this there was no personal
      note. She was the disciple of a holy cause, aflame with purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will mean a revolution,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A revolution was established two years ago,&rdquo; she pointed out, &ldquo;and the
      people have held their power ever since. I will tell you what I believe
      to-day,&rdquo; she went on passionately. &ldquo;I believe that the very class who was
      standing the firmest, whose fingers grasp most tightly the sword of
      warfare, will be most grateful to the people who will wrest the initiative
      from them and show them the way to an honourable, inevitable peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you propose to break those seals?&rdquo; he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow evening,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;There will be a full meeting of the
      Council. The terms will be read. Then you shall decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to decide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether you will accept the post of spokesman&mdash;whether you will be
      the ambassador who shall approach the Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they may not elect me,&rdquo; he objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will,&rdquo; she replied confidently. &ldquo;It was you who showed them their
      power. It is you whose inspiration has carried them along: It is you who
      shall be their representative. Don&rsquo;t you realise,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that it
      is the very association of such men as yourself and Miles Furley and the
      Bishop with this movement which will endow it with reality in the eyes of
      the bourgeoisie of the country and Parliament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their host returned, followed by his butler carrying a tray with
      refreshments, and the burden of serious things fell away from them. It was
      only after Catherine had departed, and the two men lingered for a moment
      near the fire before retiring, that either of them reverted to the great
      subject which dominated their thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, Julian,&rdquo; the Bishop said, with a shade of anxiety in his
      tone, &ldquo;that I am in the same position as yourself so far as regards the
      proposals which may lie within that envelope? I have joined this movement&mdash;or
      conspiracy, as I suppose it would be called&mdash;on the one condition
      that the terms pronounced there are such as a Christian and a law-loving
      country, whose children have already made great sacrifices in the cause of
      freedom, may honourably accept. If they are otherwise, all the weight and
      influence I may have with the people go into the other scale. I take it
      that it is so with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely,&rdquo; Julian acquiesced. &ldquo;To be frank with you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;my
      doubts are not so much concerning the terms of peace themselves as the
      power of the German democracy to enforce them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have relied a good deal,&rdquo; the Bishop admitted, &ldquo;upon reports from
      neutrals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian smiled a little grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have wasted a good many epithets criticising German diplomacy,&rdquo; he
      observed, &ldquo;but she seems to know how to hold most of the neutrals in the
      hollow of her hand. You know what that Frenchman said? &lsquo;Scratch a neutral
      and you find a German propaganda agent!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop led the way upstairs. Outside the door of Julian&rsquo;s room, he
      laid his hand affectionately upon the young man&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My godson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as yet we have scarcely spoken of this great
      surprise which you have given us&mdash;of Paul Fiske. All that I shall say
      now is this. I am very proud to know that he is my guest to-night. I am
      very happy to think that from tomorrow we shall be fellow workers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, while she waited for her tea in the Carlton lounge on the
      following afternoon, gazed through the drooping palms which sheltered the
      somewhat secluded table at which she was seated upon a very brilliant
      scene. It was just five o&rsquo;clock, and a packed crowd of fashionable
      Londoners was listening to the strains of a popular band, or as much of it
      as could be heard above the din of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all rather amazing, is it not?&rdquo; she remarked to her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, an attache at a neutral Embassy, dropped his eyeglass and
      polished it with a silk handkerchief, in the corner of which was
      embroidered a somewhat conspicuous coronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes an interesting study,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Berlin now is madly gay,
      Paris decorous and sober. It remains with London to be normal,&mdash;London
      because its hide is the thickest, its sensibility the least acute, its
      selfishness the most profound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that a philosophical history of the war will some
      day, for those who come after us, be extraordinarily interesting. I mean
      the study of the national temperaments as they were before, as they are
      now during the war, and as they will be afterwards. There is one thing
      which will always be noted, and that is the intense dislike which you,
      perhaps I, certainly the majority of neutrals, feel towards England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; the young man assented solemnly. &ldquo;One finds it everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the war,&rdquo; Catherine went on, &ldquo;it was Germany who was hated
      everywhere. She pushed her way into the best places at hotels, watering
      places&mdash;Monte Carlo, for instance and the famous spas. Today, all
      that accumulated dislike seems to be turned upon England. I am not myself
      a great admirer of this country, and yet I ask myself why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England is smug,&rdquo; the young man pronounced; &ldquo;She is callous; she is,
      without meaning to be, hypocritical. She works herself into a terrible
      state of indignation about the misdeeds of her neighbours, and she does
      not realise her own faults. The Germans are overbearing, but one realises
      that and expects it. Englishmen are irritating. It is certainly true that
      amongst us remaining neutrals,&rdquo; he added, dropping his voice a little and
      looking around to be sure of their isolation, &ldquo;the sympathy remains with
      the Central Powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some dear friends in this country, too,&rdquo; Catherine sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally&mdash;amongst those of your own order. But then there is very
      little difference between the aristocracies of every race in the world. It
      is the bourgeoisie which tells, which sets its stamp upon a nation&rsquo;s
      character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their tea had arrived, and for a few moments the conversation travelled in
      lighter channels. The young man, who was a person of some consequence in
      his own country, spoke easily of the theatres, of mutual friends, of some
      sport in which he had been engaged. Catherine relapsed into the role which
      had been her first in life,&mdash;the young woman of fashion. As such they
      attracted no attention save a few admiring glances on the part of
      passers-by towards Catherine. As the people around them thinned out a
      little, their conversation became more intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always feel,&rdquo; the young man said thoughtfully, &ldquo;that in these
      days I have lived very near great things. I have seen and realised what
      the historians will relate at second-hand. The greatest events move like
      straws in the wind. A month ago, it seemed as though the Central Powers
      would lose the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;it depends very much upon what you mean by
      winning it? The terms of peace are scarcely the terms of victory, are
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The terms of peace,&rdquo; he repeated thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We happen to know what they are, do we not?&rdquo; she continued, speaking
      almost under her breath, &ldquo;the basic terms, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;the terms put forward by the Socialist Party
      of Germany to ensure the granting of an armistice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And acceded to,&rdquo; she reminded him, &ldquo;by the Kaiser and the two greatest
      German statesmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He toyed with his teacup, drew a gold cigarette case from his pocket,
      selected a cigarette, and lit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would try to make me believe,&rdquo; he remarked, smiling at his companion,
      &ldquo;that to-day you are not in your most intelligent mood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain, if you please,&rdquo; she begged earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoked stolidly for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you preserve with me something of that very
      skilfully assumed ignorance which is the true mask of the diplomatist. But
      is it worth while, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught at her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too clever,&rdquo; she murmured, looking at him covertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how Germany, who needs peace sorely, has
      striven to use the most despised power in her country for her own
      advantage&mdash;I mean the Socialist Party. From being treated with scorn
      and ignominy, they were suddenly, at the time of the proposed Stockholm
      Conference, judged worthy of notice from the All Highest himself. He
      suddenly saw how wonderful a use might be made of them. It was a very
      clever trap which was baited, and it was not owing to any foresight or any
      cleverness on the part of this country that the Allies did not walk
      straight into it. I say again,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that it was a mere fluke
      which prevented the Allies from being represented at that Conference and
      the driving in of the thin end of the wedge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; Catherine agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;German diplomacy,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;may sometimes be obtuse, but it is at
      least persistent. Their next move will certainly rank in history as the
      most astute, the most cunning of any put forward since the war commenced.
      Of course,&rdquo; the young man went on, fitting his cigarette into a long,
      amber holder, &ldquo;we who are not Germans can only guess, but even the
      guessing is fascinating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, please, dear Baron,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It is when you talk like this
      and show me your mind that I seem to be listening to a second Bismarck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You flatter me, Countess,&rdquo; the young man said, &ldquo;but indeed these events
      are interesting. Trace their course for yourself after the failure of
      Stockholm. The Kaiser has established certain relations with the Socialist
      Party. Once more he turns towards them. He affects a war weariness he does
      not feel. He puts it into their heads that they shall approach without
      molestation certain men in England who have a great Labour following. The
      plot is started. You know quite well how it has progressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Catherine assented, &ldquo;but after all, tell me, where does the
      wonderful diplomacy come in? The terms of peace are not the terms of a
      conqueror. Germany is to engage herself to give up what she has sworn to
      hold, even to pay indemnities, to restore all conquered countries, and to
      retire her armies behind the Rhine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked at his companion steadfastly for several seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the idiom of this country, Countess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I raise my hat to you.
      You preserve your mask of ignorance to the end. So much so, indeed, that I
      find myself asking do you really believe that Germany intends to do this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you forget,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;I was one of those present at the
      discussion of the preliminaries. The confirmation of the agreed terms,
      with the signatures, has arrived, and is to be placed before the Labour
      Council at six o&rsquo;clock this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man for a moment seemed puzzled. Then he glanced at a little
      gold watch upon his wrist, knocked the cigarette from its holder and
      carefully replaced the latter in its case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very interesting, Countess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For the moment I had
      forgotten your official position amongst the English Socialists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward and touched his coat sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had forgotten nothing,&rdquo; she declared eagerly. &ldquo;There is something in
      your mind of which you have not spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have spoken a great deal of my mind&mdash;too much,
      perhaps, considering that we are seated in this very fashionable lounge,
      with many people around us. We must talk of these serious matters on
      another occasion, Countess. I shall pay my respects to your aunt, if I
      may, within the next few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you fence with me?&rdquo; she persisted, drawing on her gloves. &ldquo;You and
      I both know, so far as regards those peace terms, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we both know,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;let us keep each our own knowledge.
      Words are sometimes very dangerous, and great events are looming. So,
      Countess! You have perhaps a car, or may I have the pleasure of escorting
      you to your destination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Westminster,&rdquo; she told him, rising to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; he observed, as they made their way down the room,
      &ldquo;perhaps I had better not offer my escort, although I should very much
      like to be there in person. You are amongst those to-day who will make
      history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see me soon,&rdquo; she begged, dropping her voice a little, &ldquo;and I
      will confide in you as much as I dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is tempting,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;I should like to know what passes at that
      meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can, if you will, dine with us to-morrow night,&rdquo; she invited, &ldquo;at
      half-past eight. My aunt will be delighted to see you. I forget whether we
      have people coming or not, but you will be very welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed low as he handed his charge into a taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Countess,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I shall be charmed.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a gathering of men upon whose decision hung such momentous issues, the
      Council which met that evening at Westminster seemed alike unambitious in
      tone and uninspired in appearance. Some short time was spent in one of the
      anterooms, where Julian was introduced to many of the delegates. The
      disclosure of his identity, although it aroused immense interest, was
      scarcely an unmixed joy to the majority of them. Those who were in earnest&mdash;and
      they mostly were in grim and deadly earnest&mdash;had hoped to find him a
      man nearer their own class. Fenn and Bright had their own reasons for
      standing apart, and the extreme pacifists took note of the fact that he
      had been a soldier. His coming, however, was an event the importance of
      which nobody attempted to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop was voted into the chair when the little company trooped into
      the apartment which had been set aside for their more important meetings.
      His election had been proposed by Miles Furley, and as it was announced
      that under no circumstances would he become a candidate for the permanent
      leadership of the party, was agreed to without comment. A few notes for
      his guidance had been jotted down earlier in the day. The great subject of
      discussion was, of course, the recently received communication from an
      affiliated body of their friends in Germany, copies of which had been
      distributed amongst the members.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am asked to explain,&rdquo; the Bishop announced, in opening the proceedings,
      &ldquo;that this document which we all recognise as being of surpassing
      importance, has been copied by Mr. Fenn, himself, and that since, copies
      have been distributed amongst the members, the front door of the building
      has been closed and the telephones placed under surveillance. It is not,
      of course, possible that any of you could be mistrusted, but it is of the
      highest importance that neither the Press, the Government, nor the people
      should have any indication of what is transpiring, until the delegate whom
      you choose takes the initial step. It is proposed that until after his
      interview with the Prime Minister, no delegate shall leave the place. The
      question now arises, what of the terms themselves? I will ask each one of
      you to state his views, commencing with Miss Abbeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one of the twenty-three&mdash;or twenty-four now, including Julian&mdash;had
      a few words to say, and the tenor of their remarks was identical. For a
      basis of peace terms, the proposals were entirely reasonable, nor did they
      appear in any case to be capable of misconstruction. They were laid down
      in eight clauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The complete evacuation of Northern France and Belgium, with full
      compensation for all damage done.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Alsace and Lorraine to determine their position by vote of the entire
      population.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Servia and Roumania to be reestablished as independent kingdoms, with
      such rectifications and modifications of frontier as a joint committee
      should decide upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The German colonies to be restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The conquered parts of Mesopotamia to remain under the protection of
      the British Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Poland to be declared an independent kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Trieste and certain portions of the Adriatic seaboard to be ceded to
      Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. A world committee to be at once elected for the purpose of working out
      a scheme of international disarmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must remember,&rdquo; Miles Furley pointed out, &ldquo;that the present Government
      is practically pledged not to enter into peace negotiations with a
      Hohenzollern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, I contend,&rdquo; the Bishop observed, &ldquo;is a declaration which should
      never have been made. Whatever may be our own feelings with regard to the
      government of Germany, the Kaiser has held the nation together and is at
      the present moment its responsible head. If he has had the good sense to
      yield to the demands of his people, as is proved by this document, then it
      is very certain that the declaration must be forgotten. I have reason to
      believe, however, that even if the negotiations have been commenced in the
      name of the Kaiser, an immediate change is likely to take place in the
      constitution of Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Germany&rsquo;s new form of government, I understand,&rdquo; Fenn intervened, &ldquo;will
      be modelled upon our own, which, after the abolition of the House of
      Lords, and the abnegation of the King&rsquo;s prerogative, will be as near the
      ideal democracy as is possible. That change will be in itself our most
      potent guarantee against all future wars. No democracy ever encouraged
      bloodshed. It is, to my mind, a clearly proved fact that all wars are the
      result of court intrigue. There will be no more of that. The passing of
      monarchical rule in Germany will mean the doom of all autocracies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little sympathetic murmur. Julian, to whom Catherine had been
      whispering, next asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that no doubt can be cast upon the authenticity of
      the three signatures attached to this document?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s been in my own mind, Mr. Fiske&mdash;leastwise, Mr. Orden,&rdquo;
       Phineas Cross, the Northumbrian, remarked, from the other side of the
      table. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re up to any mortal dodge, these Germans. Are we to accept it
      as beyond all doubt that this document is entirely genuine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we do otherwise?&rdquo; Fenn demanded. &ldquo;Freistner, who is responsible
      for it, has been in unofficial correspondence with us since the
      commencement of the war. We know his handwriting, we know his character,
      we&rsquo;ve had a hundred different occasions to test his earnestness and
      trustworthiness. This document is in his own writing and accompanied by
      remarks and references to previous correspondence which render its
      authenticity indisputable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted that the proposals themselves are genuine, there still remain the
      three signatures,&rdquo; Julian observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we doubt them?&rdquo; Fenn protested. &ldquo;Freistner guarantees them,
      and Freistner is our friend, the friend and champion of Labour throughout
      the world. To attempt to deceive us would be to cover himself with eternal
      obloquy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet these terms,&rdquo; Julian pointed out, &ldquo;differ fundamentally from anything
      which Germany has yet allowed to be made public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two factors here which may be considered,&rdquo; Miles Furley
      intervened. &ldquo;The first is that the economic condition of Germany is far
      worse than she has allowed us to know. The second, which is even more
      interesting to us, is the rapid growth in influence, power, and numbers of
      the Socialist and Labour Party in that country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of both these factors,&rdquo; the Bishop reminded them, &ldquo;we have had very
      frequent hints from our friends, the neutrals. Let me tell you all what I
      think. I think that those terms are as much as we have the right to
      expect, even if our armies had reached the Rhine. It is possible that we
      might obtain some slight modifications, if we continued the war, but would
      those modifications be worth the loss of a few more hundred thousands of
      human lives, of a few more months of this hideous, pagan slaughter and
      defilement of God&rsquo;s beautiful world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of approval. A lank, rawboned Yorkshireman&mdash;David
      Sands&mdash;a Wesleyan enthusiast, a local preacher, leaned across the
      table, his voice shaking with earnestness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the word of God! It&rsquo;s for us to stop the
      war. If we stop it to-night instead of to-morrow, a thousand lives may be
      saved, human lives, lives of our fellow creatures. Our fellow labourers in
      Germany have given us the chance. Don&rsquo;t let us delay five minutes. Let the
      one of us you may select see the Prime Minister to-night and deliver the
      people&rsquo;s message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no cause for delay that I can see,&rdquo; Cross approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; Fenn assented heartily. &ldquo;I propose that we proceed to the
      election of our representative; that, having elected him, we send him to
      the Prime Minister with our message, and that we remain here in the
      building until we have his report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unanimously resolved, then,&rdquo; the Bishop asked, &ldquo;to take this last
      step?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little chorus of assent. Fenn leaned forward in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is ready,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Our machinery is perfect. Our agents
      in every city await the mandate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you imagine that those last means will be necessary?&rdquo; the Bishop
      enquired anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most surely I do,&rdquo; Fenn replied. &ldquo;Remember that if the people make peace
      for the country, it is the people who will expect to govern the country.
      It will be a notice to the politicians to quit. They know that. It is my
      belief that they will resist, tooth and nail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bright glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prime Minister,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;will be at Downing Street until nine
      o&rsquo;clock. It is now seven o&rsquo;clock. I propose that we proceed without any
      further delay to the election of our representative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The voting cards,&rdquo; Fenn pointed out, &ldquo;are before each person. Every one
      has two votes, which must be for two different representatives. The cards
      should then be folded, and I propose that the Bishop, who is not a
      candidate, collect them. As I read the unwritten rules of this Congress,
      every one here is eligible except the Bishop, Miss Abbeway, Mr. Orden and
      Mr. Furley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little murmur. Phineas Cross leaned forward in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The Bishop, and Miss Abbeway, we all
      know, are outside the running. Mr. Furley, too, represents the educated
      Socialists, and though he is with us in this, he is not really Labour. But
      Mr. Orden&mdash;Paul Fiske, eh? That&rsquo;s a different matter, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Orden,&rdquo; Fenn pronounced slowly, &ldquo;is a literary man. He is a
      sympathiser with our cause, but he is not of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any man has read the message which Paul Fiske has written with a pen
      of gold for us,&rdquo; Phineas Cross declared, &ldquo;and can still say that he is not
      one of us, why, he must be beside himself. I say that Mr. Orden is the
      brains and the soul of our movement. He brought life and encouragement
      into the north of England with the first article he ever wrote. Since then
      there has not been a man whom the Labour Party that I know anything of has
      looked up to and worshipped as they have done him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; David Sands broke in, &ldquo;every word of it. There&rsquo;s no one has
      written for Labour like him. If he isn&rsquo;t Labour, then we none of us are. I
      don&rsquo;t care whether he is the son of an earl, or a plasterer&rsquo;s apprentice,
      as I was. He&rsquo;s the right stuff, he has the gift of putting the words
      together, and his heart&rsquo;s where it should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one,&rdquo; Fenn said, his voice trembling a little, &ldquo;who has a
      greater admiration for Paul Fiske&rsquo;s writings than I have, but I still
      contend that he is not Labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, lad,&rdquo; Cross enjoined. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a vote on that. I&rsquo;m for
      saying that Mr. Julian Orden here, who has written them articles under the
      name of &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo;, is a full member of our Council and eligible to act
      as our messenger to the Prime Minister. I ask the Bishop to put it to the
      meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eighteen were unanimous in agreeing with the motion. Fenn sat down,
      speechless. His cheeks were pallid. His hands, which rested upon the
      table, were twitching. He seemed like a man lost in thought and only
      remembered to fill up his card when the Bishop asked him for it. There was
      a brief silence whilst the latter, assisted by Cross and Sands, counted
      the votes. Then the Bishop rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Julian Orden,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;better known to you all under the name
      of &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo;, has been chosen by a large majority as your
      representative to take the people&rsquo;s message to the Prime Minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest!&rdquo; Fenn exclaimed passionately. &ldquo;This is Mr. Orden&rsquo;s first visit
      amongst us. He is a stranger. I repeat that he is not one of us. Where is
      his power? He has none. Can he do what any one of us can&mdash;stop the
      pulse of the nation? Can he still its furnace fires? Can he empty the
      shipyards and factories, hold the trains upon their lines, bring the
      miners up from under the earth? Can he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can do all these things,&rdquo; Phineas Cross interrupted, &ldquo;because he
      speaks for us, our duly elected representative. Sit thee down, Fenn. If
      you wanted the job, well, you haven&rsquo;t got it, and that&rsquo;s all there is
      about it, and though you&rsquo;re as glib with your tongue as any here, and
      though you&rsquo;ve as many at your back, perchance, as I have, I tell you I&rsquo;d
      never have voted for you if there hadn&rsquo;t been another man here. So put
      that in your pipe and smoke it, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All further discussion,&rdquo; the Bishop ruled, &ldquo;is out of order. Julian
      Orden, do you accept this mission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian rose to his feet. He leaned heavily upon his stick. His expression
      was strangely disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you, my friends, this has all come very suddenly.
      I do not agree with Mr. Fenn. I consider that I am one with you. I think
      that for the last ten years I have seen the place which Labour should hold
      in the political conduct of the world. I have seen the danger of letting
      the voice of the people remain unheard too long. Russia to-day is a
      practical and terrible example of that danger. England is, in her way, a
      free country, and our Government a good one, but in the world&rsquo;s history
      there arrive sometimes crises with which no stereotyped form of government
      can cope, when the one thing that is desired is the plain, honest mandate
      of those who count for most in the world, those who, in their simplicity
      and in their absence from all political ties and precedents and liaisons,
      see the truth. That is why I have appealed with my pen to Labour, to end
      this war. That is why I shall go willingly as your representative to the
      Prime Minister to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop held out his hand. There was a little reverent hush, for his
      words were in the nature of a benediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may God be with you, our messenger,&rdquo; he said solemnly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Julian, duly embarked upon his mission, was kept waiting an unexpectedly
      short time in the large but gloomy apartment into which Mr. Stenson&rsquo;s
      butler had somewhat doubtfully ushered him. The Prime Minister entered
      with an air of slight hurry. He was also somewhat surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Orden,&rdquo; he exclaimed, holding out his hand, &ldquo;what can I do for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal,&rdquo; Julian replied gravely. &ldquo;First of all, though, I have an
      explanation to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson regretted, &ldquo;that I am too much engaged this
      evening to enter into any personal matters. I am expecting a messenger
      here on very important official business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am that messenger,&rdquo; Julian announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stenson started. His visitor&rsquo;s tone was serious and convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that we are at loggerheads. It is an envoy from the Labour Party
      whom I am expecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am that envoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; Mr. Stenson exclaimed, in blank bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to explain a little further, perhaps. I have been writing on
      Labour questions for some time under the pseudonym of &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul Fiske?&rdquo; Mr. Stenson gasped. &ldquo;You&mdash;Paul Fiske?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are amazed, of course,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;but it is nevertheless the
      truth. The fact has just come to light, and I have been invited to join
      this new emergency Council, composed of one or two Socialists and writers,
      amongst them a very distinguished prelate; Labour Members of Parliament,
      and representatives of the various Trades Unions, a body of men which you
      doubtless know all about. I attended a meeting at Westminster an hour ago,
      and I was entrusted with this commission to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stenson sat down suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&mdash;Julian Orden!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Mr. Stenson, however, was a man of immense
      recuperative powers. He assimilated the new situation without further
      protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given me the surprise of my life, Orden,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;That,
      however, is a personal matter. Hannaway Wells is in the study. You have no
      objection, I suppose, to his being present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stenson rang the bell, and in a few minutes they were joined by his
      colleague. The former wasted no time in explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will doubtless be as astonished as I was, Wells,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to learn
      that our friend Julian Orden comes here as the representative of the new
      Labour Council. His qualifications, amongst others, are that under the
      pseudonym of &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo; he is the writer of those wonderful articles
      which have been the beacon light and the inspiration of the Labour Party
      for the last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hannaway Wells prided himself upon never being surprised. This time
      the only way he could preserve his reputation was by holding his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are now prepared to hear your mission,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson continued, turning
      to his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; Julian began, &ldquo;that you know something about this new Labour
      Council?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What little we do know,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson answered, &ldquo;we have learnt with great
      difficulty through our secret service. I gather that a small league of men
      has been formed within a mile of the Houses of Parliament, who, whatever
      their motives may be, have been guilty of treasonable and traitorous
      communication with the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strictly speaking, you are, without doubt, perfectly right,&rdquo; Julian
      acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stenson switched on an electric light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Orden,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;There is no need for us to stand glaring
      at one another. There is enough of real importance in the nature of our
      interview without making melodrama of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister threw himself into an easy chair. Julian, with a little
      sigh of relief, selected a high-backed oak chair and rested his foot upon
      a hassock. Hannaway Wells remained standing upon the hearthrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight into the heart of it, please, Orden,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson begged. &ldquo;Let
      us know how far this accursed conspiracy has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has gone to very great lengths,&rdquo; Julian declared. &ldquo;Certain members of
      this newly-formed Council of Labour have been in communication for some
      months with the Socialist Party in Germany. From these latter they have
      received a definite and authentic proposal of peace, countersigned by the
      three most important men in Germany. That proposal of peace I am here to
      lay before you, with the request that you act upon it without delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian produced his roll of papers. The two men remained motionless. The
      great issue had been reached with almost paralysing rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice,&rdquo; Mr. Hannaway Wells said bluntly, &ldquo;is that you, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;turning
      to his Chief&mdash;&ldquo;refuse to discuss or consider these proposals, or to
      examine that document. I submit that you are the head of His Majesty&rsquo;s
      Government, and any communication emanating from a foreign country should
      be addressed to you. If you ever consider this matter and discuss it with
      Mr. Orden here, you associate yourself with a traitorous breach of the
      law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stenson made no immediate reply. He looked towards Julian, as though
      to hear what he had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hannaway Wells&rsquo;s advice is, without doubt, technically correct,&rdquo;
       Julian admitted, &ldquo;but the whole subject is too great, and the issues
      involved too awful for etiquette or even propriety to count. It is for
      you, sir, to decide what is best for the country. You commit yourself to
      nothing by reading the proposals, and I suggest that you do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will read them,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian passed over the papers. The two men crossed the room and leaned
      over the Prime Minister&rsquo;s writing table. Mr. Stenson drew down the
      electric light, and they remained there in close confabulation for about a
      quarter of an hour. Julian sat with his back turned towards them and his
      ears closed. In this atmosphere of government, his own position seemed to
      him weird and fantastic. A sense of unreality cumbered his thoughts. Even
      this brief pause in the actual negotiations filled him with doubts. He
      could scarcely believe that it was he who was to dictate terms to the man
      who was responsible for the government of the country; that it was he who
      was to force a decision pregnant with far-reaching consequences to the
      entire world. The figures of Fenn and Bright loomed up ominously before
      him, however hard he tried to push them into the background. Was it the
      mandate of such men as these that he was carrying?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the two Ministers returned to their places. Julian had heard
      their voices for the last few minutes without being able to distinguish a
      word of their actual conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have considered the document you have brought, Orden,&rdquo; the Prime
      Minister said, &ldquo;and we frankly admit that we find its contents surprising.
      The terms of peace suggested form a perfectly possible basis for
      negotiations. At the same time, you are probably aware that it has not
      been in the mind of His Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers to discuss terms of peace at
      all with the present administration of Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These terms,&rdquo; Julian reminded him, &ldquo;are dictated, not by the Kaiser and
      his advisers, but by the Socialist and Labour Party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson pointed out, &ldquo;that we have heard so little of
      that Party. It is even astonishing that we should find them in a position
      to be able to dictate terms of peace to the Hohenzollerns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not dispute the authenticity of the document?&rdquo; Julian asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go so far as that,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson replied cautiously. &ldquo;Our
      secret service informed us some time ago that Freistner, the head of the
      German Socialists, was in communication with certain people in this
      country. I have no doubt whatever that these are the proposals of the
      authorised Socialist Party of Germany. What I do not understand is how
      they have suddenly acquired the strength to induce proposals of peace such
      as these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been suggested,&rdquo; Julian said, &ldquo;that even the Hohenzollerns, even
      the military clique of Germany, see before them now the impossibility of
      reaping the rewards of their successful campaigns. Peace is becoming a
      necessity to them. They would prefer, therefore, to seem to yield to the
      demands of their own Socialists rather than to foreign pressure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be so,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson admitted. &ldquo;Let us proceed. The first part of
      your duty, Orden, is finished. What else have you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am instructed,&rdquo; Julian announced, &ldquo;to appeal to you to sue at once,
      through the Spanish Ambassador, for an armistice while these terms are
      considered and arrangements made for discussing them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not evade even that question. Of the twenty-three members of the
      new Council of Labour, twenty represent the Trades Unions of the great
      industries of the kingdom. Those twenty will unanimously proclaim a
      general strike, if you should refuse the proposed armistice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson observed drily, &ldquo;they will scuttle the ship
      themselves. Do you approve of these tactics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline to answer that question,&rdquo; Julian said, &ldquo;but I would point out
      to you that when you acknowledged yourself defeated by the miners of South
      Wales, you pointed the way to some such crisis as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be true,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson acknowledged. &ldquo;I have only at this moment,
      however, to deal with the present condition of affairs. Do you seriously
      believe that, if I make the only answer which at present seems to me
      possible, the Council of Labour, as they call themselves, will adopt the
      measures they threaten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that they will,&rdquo; Julian declared gravely. &ldquo;I believe that the
      country looks upon any continuation of this war as a continuation of
      unnecessary and ghastly slaughter. To appreciably change the military
      situation would mean the sacrifice of millions more lives, would mean the
      continuation of the war for another two years. I believe that the people
      of Germany who count are of the same opinion. I believe that the
      inevitable change of government in Germany will show us a nation freed
      from this hideous lust for conquest, a nation with whom, when she is
      purged of the poison of these last years, we can exist fraternally and
      with mutual benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very sanguine man, Mr. Orden,&rdquo; Hannaway Wells remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never found,&rdquo; Julian replied, &ldquo;that the pessimist walks with his
      head turned towards the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have I,&rdquo; the Prime Minister asked, after a brief pause, &ldquo;for my
      reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four hours,&rdquo; Julian told him, &ldquo;during which time it is hoped that
      you will communicate with our Allies and pave the way for a further
      understanding. The Council of Labour asks you for no pledge as to their
      safety. We know quite well that all of us are, legally speaking, guilty of
      treason. On the other hand, a single step towards the curtailment of our
      liberties will mean the paralysis of every industry in the United
      Kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I realise the position perfectly,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson observed drily. &ldquo;I do not
      exactly know what to say to you personally, Orden,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Perhaps it
      is as well for us that the Council should have chosen an ambassador with
      whom discussion, at any rate, is possible. Nevertheless, I feel bound to
      remind you that you have taken upon your shoulders, considering your birth
      and education, one of the most perilous loads which any man could carry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have weighed the consequences,&rdquo; Julian replied, with a sudden and
      curious sadness in his tone. &ldquo;I know how the name of &lsquo;pacifist&rsquo; stinks in
      the nostrils. I know how far we are committed as a nation to a peace won
      by force of arms. I know how our British blood boils at the thought of
      leaving a foreign country with as many military advantages as Germany has
      acquired. But I feel, too, that there is the other side. I have brought
      you evidence that it is not the German nation against whom we fight, man
      against man, human being against human being. It is my belief that
      autocracy and the dynasty of the Hohenzollerns will crumble into ruin as a
      result of today&rsquo;s negotiations, just as surely as though we sacrificed God
      knows how many more lives to achieve a greater measure of military
      triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an honest man, Julian Orden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and a decent emissary.
      You will reply that we take the twenty-four hours for reflection. That
      means that we shall meet at nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand in farewell, an action which somehow sent Julian away
      a happier man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Julian, on, the morning following his visit to the Prime Minister, was
      afflicted with a curious and persistent unrest. He travelled down to the
      Temple land found Miles Furley in a room hung with tobacco smoke and
      redolent of a late night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles,&rdquo; Julian declared, as the two men shook hands, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in the same fix,&rdquo; Furley admitted. &ldquo;I sat here till four o&rsquo;clock.
      Phineas Cross came around, and half-a-dozen of the others. I felt I must
      talk to them, I must keep on hammering it out. We&rsquo;re right, Julian. We
      must be right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghastly responsibility. I wonder what history will have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rdquo; Furley groaned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have a bird&rsquo;s-eye view
      of the whole affair, those people who write our requiem or our eulogy. You
      noticed the Press this morning? They&rsquo;re all hinting at some great move in
      the West. It&rsquo;s about in the clubs. Why, I even heard last night that we
      were in Ostend. It&rsquo;s all a rig, of course. Stenson wants to gain time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who opened these negotiations with Freistner?&rdquo; Julian asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fenn. He met him at the Geneva Conference, the year before the war. I met
      him, too, but I didn&rsquo;t see so much of him. He&rsquo;s a fine fellow, Julian&mdash;as
      unlike the typical German as any man you ever met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s honest, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the day itself,&rdquo; was the confident reply. &ldquo;He has been in prison
      twice, you know, for plain speaking. He is the one man in Germany who has
      fought the war, tooth and nail, from the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian caught his friend by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;straight from the bottom of your heart, mind&mdash;you
      do believe we are justified?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never doubted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that we have practically created a revolution&mdash;that we have
      established a dictatorship? Stenson must obey or face anarchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the voice of the people,&rdquo; Furley declared. &ldquo;I am convinced that we
      are justified. I am convinced of the inutility of the prolongation of this
      war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian drew a little sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I am weakening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember, I am new to this thing
      in practice, even though I may be responsible for some of the theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the people who are the soundest directors of a nation&rsquo;s policy,&rdquo;
       Furley pronounced. &ldquo;High politics becomes too much like a game of chess,
      hedged all around with etiquette and precedent. It&rsquo;s human life we want to
      save, Julian. People don&rsquo;t stop to realise the horrible tragedy of even
      one man&rsquo;s death&mdash;one man with his little circle of relatives and
      friends. In the game of war one forgets. Human beings&mdash;men from the
      toiler&rsquo;s bench, the carpenter&rsquo;s bench, from behind the counter, from the
      land, from the mine&mdash;don khaki, become soldiers, and there seems
      something different about them. So many human lives gone every day; just
      soldiers, just the toll we have to pay for a slight advance or a costly
      retreat. And, my God, every one of them, underneath their khaki, is a
      human being! The politicians don&rsquo;t grasp it, Julian. That&rsquo;s our
      justification. The day that armistice is signed, several hundred lives at
      least&mdash;perhaps, thousands&mdash;will be saved; for several hundred
      women the sun will continue to shine. Parents, sweethearts, children&mdash;all
      of them&mdash;think what they will be spared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a man again,&rdquo; Julian declared. &ldquo;Come along round to Westminster.
      There are many things I want to ask about the Executive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove round to the great building which had been taken over by the
      different members of the Labour Council. The representative of each Trades
      Union had his own office, staff of clerks and private telephone. Fenn, who
      greeted the two men with a rather excessive cordiality, constituted
      himself their cicerone. He took them from room to room and waited while
      Julian exchanged remarks with some of the delegates whom he had not met
      personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one of our members,&rdquo; Fenn pointed out, &ldquo;is in direct communication
      with the local secretary of each town in which his industry is
      represented. You see these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and laid his hand on a little heap of telegraph forms, on which
      one word was typed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;are all ready to be dispatched the second that we
      hear from Mr. Stenson that is to say if we should hear unfavourably. They
      are divided into batches, and each batch will be sent from a different
      post-office, so that there shall be no delay. We calculate that in seven
      hours, at the most, the industrial pulse of the country will have ceased
      to beat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has your organisation taken to build up?&rdquo; Julian enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly three months,&rdquo; David Sands observed, turning around in his swing
      chair from the desk at which he had been writing. &ldquo;The scheme was started
      a few days after your article in the British Review. We took your motto as
      our text &lsquo;Coordination and cooperation.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found their way into the clubroom, and at luncheon, later on, Julian
      strove to improve his acquaintance with the men who were seated around
      him. Some of them were Members of Parliament with well-known names, others
      were intensely local, but all seemed earnest and clear-sighted. Phineas
      Cross commenced to talk about war generally. He had just returned from a
      visit with other Labour Members to the front, although it is doubtful
      whether the result had been exactly in accordance with the intentions of
      the powers who had invited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something about war,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which contradicts most
      every other experience. There&rsquo;s scarcely a great subject in the world
      which you don&rsquo;t have to take as a whole, and from the biggest point of
      view, to appreciate it thoroughly. It&rsquo;s exactly different with war. If you
      want to understand more than the platitudes, you want to just take in one
      section of the fighting. Say there are fifty Englishmen, decent fellows,
      been dragged from their posts as commercial travellers or small tradesmen
      or labourers or what-not, and they get mixed up with a similar number of
      Germans. Those Germans ain&rsquo;t the fiends we read about. They&rsquo;re not
      bubbling over with militarism. They don&rsquo;t want to lord it over all the
      world. They&rsquo;ve exactly the same tastes, the same outlook upon life as the
      fifty Englishmen whom an iron hand has been forcing to do their best to
      kill. Those English chaps didn&rsquo;t want to kill anybody, any more than the
      Germans did. They had to do it, too, simply because it was part of the
      game. There was a handful of German prisoners I saw, talking with their
      guard and exchanging smokes. One was a barber in a country town. The man
      who had him in tow was an English barber. Bless you, they were talking
      like one o&rsquo;clock! That German barber didn&rsquo;t want anything in life except
      plenty to eat and drink, to be a good husband and good father, and to save
      enough money to buy a little house of his own. The Englishman was just the
      same. He&rsquo;d as soon have had that German for a pal for a day&rsquo;s fishing or a
      walk in the country, as any one else. They&rsquo;d neither of them got anything
      against the other. Where the hell is this spirit of hatred? You go down
      the line, mile after mile, and most little groups of men facing one
      another are just the same. Here and there, there&rsquo;s some bitter feeling,
      through some fighting that&rsquo;s seemed unfair, but that&rsquo;s nothing. The fact
      remains that those millions of men don&rsquo;t hate one another, that they&rsquo;ve
      got nothing to hate one another about, and they&rsquo;re being driven to
      slaughter one another like savage beasts. For what? Mr. Stenson might
      supply an answer. Your great editors might. Your great Generals could be
      glib about it. They could spout volumes of words, but there&rsquo;s no substance
      about them. I say that in this generation there&rsquo;s no call for fighting,
      and there didn&rsquo;t ought to be any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not only right, but you are splendidly right, Mr. Cross,&rdquo; Julian
      declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s human talk, that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a plain man&rsquo;s words and thoughts,&rdquo; was the simple reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Fenn complained, in his thin voice, &ldquo;if I talk like that, they
      call me a pacifist, a lot of rowdies get up and sing &lsquo;Rule Britannia&rsquo;, and
      try to chivy me out of the hall where I&rsquo;m speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, there&rsquo;s a difference, lad,&rdquo; Cross pointed out, setting down the
      tankard of beer from which he had been drinking. &ldquo;You talk sometimes that
      white-livered stuff about not hitting a man back if he wants to hit you,
      and you drag in your conscience, and prate about all men being brothers,
      and that sort of twaddle. A full-blooded Englishman don&rsquo;t like it, because
      we are all of us out to protect what we&rsquo;ve got, any way and anyhow. But
      that doesn&rsquo;t alter the fact that there&rsquo;s something wrong in the world when
      we&rsquo;re driven to do this protecting business wholesale and being forced
      into murdering on a scale which only devils could have thought out and
      imagined. It&rsquo;s the men at the top that are responsible for this war, and
      when people come to reckon up, they&rsquo;ll say that there was blame up at the
      top in the Government of every Power that&rsquo;s fighting, but there was a
      damned sight more blame amongst the Germans than any of the others, and
      that&rsquo;s why many a hundred thousand of our young men who&rsquo;ve loathed the war
      and felt about it as I do have gone and done their bit and kept their
      mouths shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot deny,&rdquo; Fenn argued, &ldquo;that war is contrary to Christianity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno, lad,&rdquo; Cross replied, winking across the table at Julian. &ldquo;Seems
      to me there was a powerful lot of fighting in the Old Testament, and the
      Lord was generally on one side or the other. But you and I ain&rsquo;t going to
      bicker, Mr. Fenn. The first decision this Council came to, when it
      embraced more than a dozen of us of very opposite ways of thinking, was to
      keep our mouths shut about our own ideas and stick to business. So give me
      a fill of baccy from your pipe, and we&rsquo;ll have a cup of coffee together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian&rsquo;s pouch was first upon the table, and the Northumbrian filled his
      pipe in leisurely fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good stuff, sir,&rdquo; he declared approvingly, as he passed it back. &ldquo;After
      dinner I am mostly a man of peace&mdash;even when Fenn comes yapping
      around,&rdquo; he added, looking after the disappearing figure of the secretary.
      &ldquo;But I make no secret of this. I tumbled to it from the first that this
      was a great proposition, this amalgamation of Labour. It makes a power of
      us, even though it may, as you, Mr. Orden, said in one of your articles,
      bring us to the gates of revolution. But it was all I could do to bring
      myself to sit down at the same table with Fenn and his friend Bright. You
      see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;there may be times when you are forced into doing a
      thing that fundamentally you disapprove of and you know is wrong. I
      disapprove of this war, and I know it&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;it&rsquo;s a foul mess that
      we&rsquo;ve been got into by those who should have known better&mdash;but I
      ain&rsquo;t like Fenn about it. We&rsquo;re in it, and we&rsquo;ve got to get out of it, not
      like cowards but like Englishmen, and if fighting had been the only way
      through, then I should have been for fighting to the last gasp.
      Fortunately, we&rsquo;ve got into touch with the sensible folk on the other
      side. If we hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll say no more but that I&rsquo;ve got two boys
      fighting and one buried at Ypres, and I&rsquo;ve another, though he&rsquo;s over
      young, doing his drill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cross,&rdquo; Julian said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve done me more good than any one I&rsquo;ve
      talked to since the war began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, lad,&rdquo; Cross replied. &ldquo;You get straight words from one; and
      not only that, you get the words of another million behind me, who feel as
      I do. But,&rdquo; he added, glancing across the room and lowering his voice,
      &ldquo;keep your eye on that artful devil, Fenn. He doesn&rsquo;t bear you any
      particular good will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t exactly a hospitable gaoler,&rdquo; Julian reminiscently observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not speaking of that only,&rdquo; Cross went on. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t one of us
      who didn&rsquo;t vote for squeezing that document out of you one way or the
      other, and if it had been necessary to screw your neck off for it, I don&rsquo;t
      know as one of us would have hesitated, for you were standing between us
      and the big thing. But he and that little skunk Bright ain&rsquo;t to be
      trusted, in my mind, and it seems to me they&rsquo;ve got a down on you. Fenn
      counted on being heart of this Council, for one thing, and there&rsquo;s a
      matter of a young woman, eh, for another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young woman?&rdquo; Julian repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Russian young person&mdash;Miss Abbeway, she calls herself. Fenn&rsquo;s
      been her lap-dog round here&mdash;takes her out to dine and that. It&rsquo;s
      just a word of warning, that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;re new amongst us, Mr. Orden, and
      you might think us all honest men. Well, we ain&rsquo;t; that&rsquo;s all there is to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian recovered from a momentary fit of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you for your candour, Mr. Cross,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never you mind about the &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; the Northumbrian begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor you about the &lsquo;sir&rsquo;,&rdquo; Julian retorted, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middle stump,&rdquo; Cross acknowledged. &ldquo;And since we are on the subject, my
      new friend, let me tell you this. To feel perfectly happy about this
      Council, there&rsquo;s just three as I should like to see out of it&mdash;Fenn,
      Bright&mdash;and the young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the young lady?&rdquo; Julian asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well ask me, &lsquo;Why Fenn and Bright?&rsquo;&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;I
      shouldn&rsquo;t make no answer. We&rsquo;re superstitious, you know, we north country
      folk, and we are all for instincts. All I can say to you is that there
      isn&rsquo;t one of those three I&rsquo;d trust around the corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbeway is surely above suspicion?&rdquo; Julian protested. &ldquo;She has given
      up a great position and devoted the greater part of her fortune towards
      the causes which you and I and all of us are working for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be plenty of work for her in Russia just now,&rdquo; Cross observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No person of noble birth,&rdquo; Julian reminded him, &ldquo;has the slightest chance
      of working effectively in Russia to-day. Besides, Miss Abbeway is half
      English. Failing Russia, she would naturally select this as the country in
      which she could do most good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some retort seemed to fade away upon the other&rsquo;s lips. His shaggy eyebrows
      were drawn a little closer together as he glanced towards the door. Julian
      followed the direction of his gaze. Catherine had entered and was looking
      around as though in search of some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine was more heavily veiled than usual. Her dress and hat were of
      sombre black, and her manner nervous and disturbed. She came slowly
      towards their end of the table, although she was obviously in search of
      some one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to know where Mr. Fenn is?&rdquo; she enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fenn was here a few minutes ago,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but he left us abruptly. I
      fancy that he rather disapproved of our conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone to his room perhaps,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will go upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away. Julian, however, followed her to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I see you again before you leave?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;if you wish to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s perceptible pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come upstairs with me to Mr. Fenn&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if your business is in any way private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to ascend the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t private,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I particularly want Mr. Fenn to tell me
      something, and as you know, he is peculiar. Perhaps, if you don&rsquo;t mind, it
      would be better if you waited for me downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian&rsquo;s response was a little vague. She left him, however, without
      appearing to notice his reluctance and knocked at the door of Fenn&rsquo;s room.
      She found him seated behind a desk, dictating some letters to a
      stenographer, whom he waved away at her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to see you, Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he declared impressively,
      &ldquo;delighted! Come and sit down, please, and talk to me. We have had a
      tremendous morning. Even though the machine is all ready to start, it
      needs a watchful hand all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank into the chair from which he had swept a pile of papers and
      raised her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I came to you because I have been very
      worried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew a little into himself. His eyes narrowed. His manner became
      more cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worried?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you this: have you heard anything from Freistner during the
      last day or two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn&rsquo;s face was immovable. He still showed no signs of discomposure&mdash;his
      voice only was not altogether natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last day or two?&rdquo; he repeated reflectively. &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say that I have,
      Miss Abbeway. I needn&rsquo;t remind you that we don&rsquo;t risk communications
      except when they are necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you try and get into touch with him at once?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Fenn asked, glancing at her searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of our Russian writers,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;once wrote that there are a
      thousand eddies in the winds of chance. One of those has blown my way
      to-day&mdash;or rather yesterday. Freistner is above all suspicion, is he
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far above,&rdquo; was the confident reply. &ldquo;I am not the only one who knows
      him. Ask the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it possible that he himself can have been deceived?&rdquo; she
      persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his own strength&mdash;the strength of his own Party,&rdquo; she proceeded
      eagerly. &ldquo;Do you think it possible that the Imperialists have pretended to
      recognise in him a far greater factor in the situation than he really is?
      Have pretended to acquiesce in these terms of peace with the intention of
      repudiating them when we have once gone too far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn seemed for a moment to have shrunk in his chair. His eyes had fallen
      before her passionate gaze. The penholder which he was grasping snapped in
      his fingers. Nevertheless, his voice still performed its office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;who or what has been putting these
      ideas into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A veritable chance,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;brought me yesterday afternoon into
      contact with a man&mdash;a neutral&mdash;who is supposed to be very
      intimately acquainted with what goes on in Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he tell you?&rdquo; Fenn demanded feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me nothing,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I have no more to go on than an
      uplifted eyebrow. All the same, I came away feeling uneasy. I have felt
      wretched ever since. I am wretched now. I beg you to get at once into
      touch with Freistner. You can do that now without any risk. Simply ask him
      for a confirmation of the existing situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite easy,&rdquo; Fenn promised. &ldquo;I will do it without delay. But in
      the meantime,&rdquo; he added, moistening his dry lips, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you possibly get
      to know what this man&mdash;this neutral&mdash;is driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I shall try. I have invited him to dine
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you discover anything, when shall you let us know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;I shall telephone for Mr. Orden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he lost control of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Mr. Orden?&rdquo; he demanded passionately. &ldquo;He is the youngest member of
      the Council. He knows nothing of our negotiations with Freistner. Surely I
      am the person with whom you should communicate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be very late to-night,&rdquo; she reminded him, &ldquo;and Mr. Orden is my
      personal friend&mdash;outside the Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I not?&rdquo; he asked fiercely. &ldquo;I want to be. I have tried to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She appeared to find his agitation disconcerting, and she withdrew a
      little from the yellow-stained fingers which had crept out towards hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all friends,&rdquo; she said evasively. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;if there is
      anything important, then&mdash;I will come, or send for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet, less, it seemed, as an act of courtesy in view of her
      departure, than with the intention of some further movement. He suddenly
      reseated himself, however, his fingers grasped at the air, he became
      ghastly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, Mr. Fenn?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He poured himself out a glass of water with trembling fingers and drank it
      unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nerves, I suppose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to carry the whole burden of these
      negotiations upon my shoulders, with very little help from any one, with
      none of the sympathy that counts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A momentary impulse of kindness did battle with her invincible dislike of
      the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;that yours is a glorious work; that our
      thoughts and gratitude are with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are they?&rdquo; he demanded, with another little burst of passion.
      &ldquo;Gratitude, indeed! If the Council feel that, why was I not selected to
      approach the Prime Minister instead of Julian Orden? Sympathy! If you, the
      one person from whom I desire it, have any to offer, why can you not be
      kinder? Why can you not respond, ever so little, to what I feel for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a moment, seeking for the words which would hurt him
      least. Tactless as ever, he misunderstood her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have had one small check in my career,&rdquo; he continued eagerly, &ldquo;but
      the game is not finished. Believe me, I have still great cards up my
      sleeve. I know that you have been used to wealth and luxury. Miss
      Abbeway,&rdquo; he went on, his voice dropping to a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;I was not
      boasting the other night. I have saved money, I have speculated
      fortunately&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The look in her eyes stifled his eloquence. He broke off in his speech&mdash;became
      dumb and voiceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;once and for all this sort of conversation is
      distasteful to me. A great deal of what you say I do not understand. What
      I do understand, I dislike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him, with an inscrutable look. He made no effort to open the door
      for her. He simply stood listening to her departing footsteps, listened to
      the shrill summons of the lift-bell, listened to the lift itself go
      clanging downwards. Then he resumed his seat at his desk. With his hands
      clasped nervously together, an ink smear upon his cheek, his mouth
      slightly open, disclosing his irregular and discoloured teeth, he was not
      by any means a pleasant looking object.
    </p>
    <p>
      He blew down a tube by his side and gave a muttered order. In a few
      minutes Bright presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am busy,&rdquo; the latter observed curtly, as he closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be busier in a few minutes,&rdquo; was the harsh reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a screw loose somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bright stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one been disagreeable?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down to your office at once,&rdquo; Fenn directed briefly. &ldquo;Have Miss
      Abbeway followed. I want reports of her movements every hour. I shall be
      here all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bright grinned unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another Samson, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Hell, and do as you&rsquo;re told!&rdquo; was the fierce reply. &ldquo;Put your best
      men on the job. I must know, for all our sakes, the name of the neutral
      whom Miss Abbeway sees to-night and with whom she is exchanging
      confidences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bright left the room with a shrug of the shoulders. Nicholas Fenn turned
      up the electric light, pulled out a bank book from the drawer of his desk,
      and, throwing it on to the fire, watched it until it was consumed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Baron Hellman, comfortably seated at the brilliantly decorated round
      dining table, between Catherine, on one side, and a lady to whom he had
      not been introduced, contemplated the menu through his immovable eyeglass
      with satisfaction, unfolded his napkin, and continued the conversation
      with his hostess, a few places away, which the announcement of dinner had
      interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, Princess,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The position of neutrals, especially in the diplomatic world, becomes, in
      the case of a war like this, most difficult and sometimes embarrassing. To
      preserve a correct attitude is often a severe strain upon one&rsquo;s
      self-restraint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess nodded sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very charming young man, the Baron,&rdquo; she confided to the General who
      had taken her in to dinner. &ldquo;I knew his father and his uncle quite well,
      in those happy days before the war, when one used to move from country to
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diplomatic type of features,&rdquo; the General remarked, who hated all
      foreigners. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather bad luck on them,&rdquo; he went on, with bland
      insularity, &ldquo;that the men of the European neutrals&mdash;Dutch, Danish,
      Norwegians or Swedes&mdash;all resemble Germans so much more than
      Englishmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron turned towards Catherine and ventured upon a whispered
      compliment. She was wearing a wonderful pre-war dress of black velvet,
      close-fitting yet nowhere cramping her naturally delightful figure. A rope
      of pearls hung from her neck&mdash;her only ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is permitted, Countess, to express one&rsquo;s appreciation of your
      toilette?&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England it is not usual,&rdquo; she reminded him, with a smile, &ldquo;but as you
      are such an old friend of the family, we will call it permissible. It is,
      as a matter of fact, the last gown I had from Paris. Nowadays, one thinks
      of other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are one of the few women,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;who mix in the great affairs
      and yet remain intensely feminine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;the great affairs do not please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet they are interesting,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The atmosphere at the present
      moment is electric, charged with all manner of strange possibilities. But
      we talk too seriously. Will you not let me know the names of some of your
      guests? With General Crossley I am already acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They really don&rsquo;t count for very much,&rdquo; she said, a little carelessly.
      &ldquo;This is entirely aunt&rsquo;s Friday night gathering, and they are all her
      friends. That is Lady Maltenby opposite you, and her husband on the other
      side of my aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maltenby,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Ah, yes! There is one son a Brigadier, is there
      not? And another one sees sometimes about town&mdash;a Mr. Julian Orden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the youngest son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I exceeding the privileges of friendship, Countess,&rdquo; the Baron
      continued, &ldquo;if I enquire whether there was not a rumour of an engagement
      between yourself and Mr. Orden, a few days ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in the air,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but at present nothing is settled. Mr.
      Orden has peculiar habits. He disappeared from Society altogether, a few
      days ago, and has only just returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A censor, was he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of the sort,&rdquo; Catherine assented. &ldquo;He went out to France,
      though, and did extremely well. He lost his foot there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed that he uses a stick,&rdquo; the Baron remarked. &ldquo;I always find
      him a young man of pleasant and distinguished appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Catherine continued, &ldquo;that is Mr. Braithwaiter the playwright, a
      little to the left&mdash;the man, with the smooth grey hair and eyeglass.
      Mrs. Hamilton Beardsmore you know, of course; her husband is commanding
      his regiment in Egypt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady on my left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Grayson. She comes up from the country once a month to buy food. You
      needn&rsquo;t mind her. She is stone deaf and prefers dining to talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am relieved,&rdquo; the Baron confessed, with a little sigh. &ldquo;I addressed her
      as we sat down, and she made no reply. I began to wonder if I had
      offended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man next me,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;is Mr. Millson Gray. He is an American
      millionaire, over here to study our Y.M.C.A. methods. He can talk of
      nothing else in the world but Y.M.C.A. huts and American investments, and
      he is very hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conditions,&rdquo; the Baron observed, &ldquo;seem favourable for a tete-a-tete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine smiled up into his imperturbable face. The wine had brought a
      faint colour to her cheeks, and the young man sighed regretfully at the
      idea of her prospective engagement. He had always been one of Catherine&rsquo;s
      most pronounced admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are we to talk about?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;On the really interesting
      subjects your lips are always closed. You are a marvel of discretion, you
      know, Baron&mdash;even to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is perhaps because you hide your real personality under so many
      aliases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must think that over,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;are an aristocrat of the aristocrats. I can quite
      conceive that you found your position in Russia incompatible with modern
      ideas. The Russian aristocracy, if you will forgive my saying so, is in
      for a bad time which it has done its best to thoroughly deserve. But in
      England your position is scarcely so comprehensible. Here you come to a
      sanely governed country, which is, to all effects and purposes, a country
      governed by the people for the people. Yet here, within two years, you
      have made yourself one of the champions of democracy. Why? The people are
      not ill-treated. On the contrary, I should call them pampered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; she explained earnestly. &ldquo;In Russia it was the
      aristocracy who oppressed the people, shamefully and malevolently. In
      England it is the bourgeoisie who rule the country and stand in the light
      of Labour. It is the middleman, the profiteer, the new capitalist here who
      has become an ugly and a dominant power. Labour has the means by which to
      assert itself and to claim its rights, but has never possessed the leaders
      or the training. That has been the subject of my lectures over here from
      the beginning. I want to teach the people how to crush the middleman. I
      want to show them how to discover and to utilise their strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that a little dangerous?&rdquo; he enquired. &ldquo;You might easily produce a
      state of chaos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a time, perhaps,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but never for long. You see, the
      British have one transcendental quality; they possess common sense. They
      are not idealists like the Russians. The men with whom I mix neither walk
      with their heads turned to the clouds nor do they grope about amongst the
      mud. They just look straight ahead of them, and they ask for what they see
      in the path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;And now, having reached just this stage in our
      conversation, let me ask you this. You read the newspapers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diligently,&rdquo; she assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware of a very curious note of unrest during the last few days&mdash;hints
      at a crisis in the war which nothing in the military situation seems to
      justify&mdash;vague but rather gloomy suggestions of an early peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one is talking about it,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I think that you and I have
      some idea as to what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And somehow,&rdquo; she went on, dropping her voice a little, &ldquo;I believe that
      your knowledge goes farther than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave no sign, made no answer. Some question from across the table, with
      reference to the action of one of his country&rsquo;s Ministers, was referred to
      him. He replied to it and drifted quite naturally into a general
      conversation. Without any evident effort, he seemed to desire to bring his
      tete-a-tete with Catherine to a close. She showed no sign of
      disappointment; indeed she fell into his humour and made vigorous efforts
      to attack the subject of Y.M.C.A. huts with her neighbour on the right.
      The rest of the meal passed in this manner, and it was not until they met,
      an hour later, in the Princess&rsquo; famous reception room, that they exchanged
      more than a casual word. The Princess liked to entertain her guests in a
      fashion of her own. The long apartment, with its many recesses and deep
      windows, an apartment which took up the whole of one side of the large
      house, had all the dignity and even splendour of a drawing-room, and yet,
      with its little palm court, its cosy divans, its bridge tables and
      roulette board, encouraged an air of freedom which made it eminently
      habitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, Baron,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what time you are leaving, and whether I
      could rely upon your escort to the Lawsons&rsquo; dance? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to say
      if you have an engagement, as it only means my telephoning to some
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am entirely at your service, Countess,&rdquo; he answered promptly. &ldquo;As a
      matter of fact, I have already promised to appear there myself for an
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would like to play bridge now, perhaps?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Princess was kind enough to invite me,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I ventured
      to excuse myself. I saw that the numbers were even without me, and I hoped
      for a little more conversation with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They seated themselves in an exceedingly comfortable corner. A footman
      brought them coffee, and a butler offered strange liqueurs. Catherine
      leaned back with a little sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one calls this room of my aunt&rsquo;s the hotel lounge,&rdquo; she remarked.
      &ldquo;Personally, I love it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me, also, it is the ideal apartment,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;Here we are
      alone, and I may ask you a question which was on my lips when we had tea
      together at the Carlton, and which, but for our environment, I should
      certainly have asked you at dinner time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may ask me anything,&rdquo; she assured him, with a little smile. &ldquo;I am
      feeling happy and loquacious. Don&rsquo;t tempt me to talk, or I shall give away
      all my life&rsquo;s secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will only ask you for one just now,&rdquo; he promised. &ldquo;Is it true that you
      have to-day had some disagreement with&mdash;shall I say a small congress
      of men who have their meetings down at Westminster, and with whom you have
      been in close touch for some time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her start was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth do you know anything about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when, if one is to succeed in my
      profession, one must know everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak for a moment. His question had been rather a shock to
      her. In a moment or two, however, she found herself wondering how to use
      it for her own advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked intently at the point of his patent shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this not a case, Countess,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;in which you and I might
      perhaps come a little closer together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have anything to suggest, I am ready to listen,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if I am right in some of my ideas? I shall test
      them. You have taken up your abode in England. That was natural, for
      domestic reasons. You have shown a great interest in a certain section of
      the British public. It is my theory that your interest in England is for
      that section only; that as a country, you are no more an admirer of her
      characteristics than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perfectly right,&rdquo; she answered coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your interest,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;is in the men and women toilers of the
      world, the people who carry on their shoulders the whole burden of life,
      and whose position you are continually desiring to ameliorate. I take it
      that your sympathy is international?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she assented
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People of this order in&mdash;say&mdash;Germany, excite your sympathy in
      the same degree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; he propounded, &ldquo;you are working for the betterment of the
      least considered class, whether it be German, Austrian, British, or
      French?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also is true,&rdquo; she agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pursue my theory, then. The issue of this war leaves you indifferent,
      so long as the people come to their own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My work for the last few weeks amongst those men of whom you have been
      speaking,&rdquo; she pointed out, &ldquo;should prove that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are through the wood and in the open, then,&rdquo; he declared, with a
      little sigh of relief. &ldquo;Now I am prepared to trade secrets with you. I am
      not a friend of this country. Neither my Chief nor my Government have the
      slightest desire to see England win the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I knew,&rdquo; she acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I ask you for information,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Tell me this? Your
      pseudo-friends have presented the supposed German terms of peace to Mr.
      Stenson. What was the result?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is taking twenty-four hours to consider them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will happen if he refuses?&rdquo; the Baron asked, leaning a little
      towards her. &ldquo;Will they use their mighty weapon? Will they really go the
      whole way, or will they compromise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not compromise,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;The telegrams to the
      secretaries of the various Trades Unions are already written out. They
      will be despatched five minutes after Mr. Stenson&rsquo;s refusal to sue for an
      armistice has been announced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it beyond any shadow of doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your information,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;is valuable to me. Well though I am
      served, I cannot penetrate into the inner circles of the Council itself.
      Your news is good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I expect the most amazing revelations from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have them, with pleasure,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Freistner has been in a
      German fortress for some weeks and may be shot at any moment. The supposed
      strength of the Socialist Party in Germany is an utter sham. The
      signatures attached to the document which was handed to your Council some
      days ago will be repudiated. The whole scheme of coming into touch with
      your Labour classes has been fostered and developed by the German War
      Cabinet. England will be placed in the most humiliating and ridiculous
      position. It will mean the end of the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Germany?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Germany,&rdquo; the Baron pronounced calmly, &ldquo;will have taken the first great
      step up the ladder in her climb towards the dominance of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were one or two amongst those present in the Council room at
      Westminster that evening, who noted and never forgot a certain indefinable
      dignity which seemed to come to Stenson&rsquo;s aid and enabled him to face what
      must have been an unwelcome and anxious ordeal without discomposure or
      disquiet. He entered the room accompanied by Julian and Phineas Cross, and
      he had very much the air of a man who has come to pay a business visit,
      concerning the final issue of which there could be no possible doubt. He
      shook hands with the Bishop gravely but courteously, nodded to the others
      with whom he was acquainted, asked the names of the few strangers present,
      and made a careful mental note of what industries and districts they
      represented. He then accepted a chair by the side of the Bishop, who
      immediately opened the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; the latter began, &ldquo;as I sent word to you a little time ago,
      Mr. Stenson has preferred to bring you his answer himself. Our ambassador&mdash;Mr.
      Julian Orden&mdash;waited upon him at Downing Street at the hour arranged
      upon, and, in accordance with his wish to meet you all, Mr. Stenson is
      paying us this visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop hesitated, and the Prime Minister promptly drew his chair a
      little farther into the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the issue which you have raised is so tremendous,
      and its results may well be so catastrophic, that I thought it my duty to
      beg Mr. Orden to arrange for me to come and speak to you all, to explain
      to you face to face why, on behalf of His Majesty&rsquo;s Government, I cannot
      do your bidding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want peace, then?&rdquo; one of the delegates from the other side of
      the table asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not,&rdquo; was the quiet reply. &ldquo;We are not ready for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country is,&rdquo; Fenn declared firmly. &ldquo;We are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your ambassador has told me,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;In point of numbers
      you may be said, perhaps, to represent the nation. In point of intellect,
      of knowledge&mdash;of inner knowledge, mind&mdash;I claim that I represent
      it. I tell you that a peace now, even on the terms which your Socialist
      allies in Germany have suggested, would be for us a peace of dishonour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell us why?&rdquo; the Bishop begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is not the peace we promised our dead or our living heroes,&rdquo;
       Mr. Stenson said slowly. &ldquo;We set out to fight for democracy&mdash;your
      cause. That fight would be a failure if we allowed the proudest, the most
      autocratic, the most conscienceless despot who ever sat upon a throne to
      remain in his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is just what we shall not do,&rdquo; Fenn interrupted. &ldquo;Freistner has
      assured us of that. The peace is not the Kaiser&rsquo;s peace. It is the peace
      of the Socialist Party in Germany, and the day the terms are proclaimed,
      democracy there will score its first triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find neither in the European Press nor in the reports of our secret
      service agents the slightest warrant for any such supposition,&rdquo; Mr.
      Stenson pronounced with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read Freistner&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo; Fenn asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word of it,&rdquo; the Prime Minister replied. &ldquo;I believe that Freistner
      is an honest man, as honest as any of you, but I think that he is
      mistaken. I do not believe that the German people are with him. I am
      content to believe that those signatures are genuine. I will even believe
      that Germany would welcome those terms of peace, although she would never
      allow them to proceed from her own Cabinet. But I do not believe that the
      clash and turmoil which would follow their publication would lead to the
      overthrow of the German dynasty. You give me no proof of it, gentlemen.
      You have none yourselves. And therefore I say that you propose to work in
      the dark, and it seems to me that your work may lead to an evil end. I
      want you to listen to me for one moment,&rdquo; he went on, his face lighting up
      with a flash of terrible earnestness. &ldquo;I am not going to cast about in my
      mind for flowery phrases or epigrams. We are plain men here together, with
      our country&rsquo;s fate in the balance. For God&rsquo;s sake, realise your
      responsibilities. I want peace. I ache for it. But there will be no peace
      for Europe while Germany remains an undefeated autocracy. We&rsquo;ve promised
      our dead and our living to oust that corrupt monster from his throne.
      We&rsquo;ve promised it to France our glorious Allies. We&rsquo;ve shaken hands about
      it with America, whose ships are already crowding the seas, and whose
      young manhood has taken the oath which ours has taken. This isn&rsquo;t the time
      for peace. I am not speaking in the dark when I tell you that we have a
      great movement pending in the West which may completely alter the whole
      military situation. Give us a chance. If you carry out your threat, you
      plunge this country into revolution, you dishonour us in the face of our
      Allies; you will go through the rest of your lives, every one of you, with
      a guilt upon your souls, a stain upon your consciences, which nothing will
      ever obliterate. You see, I have kept my word&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t said much. I
      cannot ask for the armistice you suggest. If you take this step you
      threaten&mdash;I do not deny its significance you will probably stop the
      war. One of you will come in and take my place. There will be turmoil,
      confusion, very likely bloodshed. I know what the issue will be, and yet I
      know my duty. There is not one member of my Cabinet who is not with me. We
      refuse your appeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one at the table seemed to be talking at the same time to every one
      else. Then Cross&rsquo;s voice rose above the others. He rose to his feet to
      ensure attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is one point in what Mr. Stenson has been saying
      which I think we might and ought to consider a little more fully, and that
      is, what guarantees have we that Freistner really has the people at the
      back of him, that he&rsquo;ll be able to cleanse that rat pit at Berlin of the
      Hohenzollern and his clan of junkers&mdash;the most accursed type of
      politician who ever breathed? We ought to be very sure about this. Fenn&rsquo;s
      our man. What about it, Fenn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freistner&rsquo;s letters for weeks,&rdquo; Fenn answered, &ldquo;have spoken of the
      wonderful wave of socialistic feeling throughout the country. He is an
      honest man, and he does not exaggerate. He assures us that half the nation
      is pledged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One man,&rdquo; David Sands remarked thoughtfully. &ldquo;If, there is a weak point
      about this business, which I am not prepared wholly to admit, it is that
      the entire job on that side seems to be run by one man. There&rsquo;s a score of
      us. I should like to hear of more on the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson pointed out, &ldquo;that so little news of this
      gain of strength on the part of the Socialists has been allowed to escape
      from Germany. However rigid their censorship, copies of German newspapers
      reach us every day from neutral countries. I cannot believe that Socialism
      has made the advance Freistner claims for it, and I agree with our
      friends, Mr. Cross and Mr. Sands here, that you ought to be very sure that
      Freistner is not deceived before you take this extreme measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are content to trust to our brothers in Germany,&rdquo; Fenn declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not convinced that we should be wise to do so,&rdquo; Julian intervened.
      &ldquo;I am in favour of our taking a few more days to consider this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am against any delay,&rdquo; Fenn objected hotly. &ldquo;I am for immediate
      action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me explain where I think we have been a little hasty,&rdquo; Julian
      continued earnestly. &ldquo;I gather that the whole correspondence between this
      body and the Socialist Party in Germany has been carried on by Mr. Fenn
      and Freistner. There are other well-known Socialists in Germany, but from
      not one of these have we received any direct communication. Furthermore&mdash;and
      I say this without wishing to impugn in any way the care with which I am
      sure our secretary has transcribed these letters&mdash;at a time like this
      I am forced to remember that I have seen nothing but copies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn was on his feet in a moment, white with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insinuate that I have altered or forged the letters?&rdquo; he
      shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made no insinuations,&rdquo; Julian replied. &ldquo;At the same time, before
      we proceed to extremities, I propose that we spend half an hour studying
      the originals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s common sense,&rdquo; Cross declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one can object to that.
      I&rsquo;m none so much in favour of these typewritten slips myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn turned to whisper to Bright. Mr. Stenson rose to his feet. The glare
      of the unshaded lamp fell upon his strained face. He seemed to have grown
      older and thinner since his entrance into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can neither better nor weaken my cause by remaining,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only
      let this be my parting word to you. Upon my soul as an Englishman, I
      believe that if you send out those telegrams to-night, if you use your
      hideous and deadly weapon against me and the Government, I believe that
      you will be guilty of this country&rsquo;s ruin, as you certainly will of her
      dishonour. You have the example of Russia before you. And I will tell you
      this, too, which take into your hearts. There isn&rsquo;t one of those men who
      are marching, perhaps to-night, perhaps tomorrow, to a possible death, who
      would thank you for trying, to save their lives or bodies at the expense
      of England&rsquo;s honour. Those about to die would be your sternest critics. I
      can say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian walked with the Premier towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stenson,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you have said just what could be said from
      your point of view, and God knows, even now, who is in the right! You are
      looking at the future with a very full knowledge of many things of which
      we are all ignorant. You have, quite naturally, too, the politician&rsquo;s
      hatred of the methods these people propose. I myself am inclined to think
      that they are a little hasty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orden,&rdquo; Mr. Stenson replied sternly, &ldquo;I did not come to you to-night as a
      politician. I have spoken as a man and an Englishman, as I speak to you
      now. For the love of your country and her honour, use your influence with
      these people. Stop those telegrams. Work for delay at any cost. There&rsquo;s
      something inexplicable, sinister, about the whole business. Freistner may
      be an honest man, but I&rsquo;ll swear that he hasn&rsquo;t the influence or the
      position that these people have been led to believe. And as for Nicholas
      Fenn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister paused. Julian waited anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my belief,&rdquo; the former concluded deliberately, &ldquo;that thirty seconds
      in the courtyard of the Tower, with his back to the light, would about
      meet his case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted at the door, and Julian returned to his seat, uneasy and
      perplexed. Around the Council table voices were raised in anger. Fenn, who
      was sitting moodily with folded arms, his chair drawn a little back from
      the table, scowled at him as he took his place. Furley, who had been
      whispering to the Bishop, turned towards Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;that the originals of most of Freistner&rsquo;s
      communications have been destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; Fenn demanded passionately. &ldquo;Why should I keep letters
      which would lay a rope around my neck any day they were found? You all
      know as well as I do that we&rsquo;ve been expecting the police to raid the
      place ever since we took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a late comer,&rdquo; Julian observed, &ldquo;but surely some of you others have
      seen the original communications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Evans spoke up from the other end of the table,&mdash;a small,
      sturdily built man, a great power in South Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be frank,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like these insinuations. Fenn&rsquo;s been our
      secretary from the first. He opened the negotiations, and he&rsquo;s carried
      them through. We either trust him, or we don&rsquo;t. I trust him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re not right, lad.&rdquo; Cross declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for being
      cautious, but it&rsquo;s more with the idea that our German friends themselves
      may be a little too sanguine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will pledge my word,&rdquo; Fenn pronounced fiercely, &ldquo;to the truth of all
      the facts I have laid before you. Whatever my work may have been, to-day
      it is completed. I have brought you a people&rsquo;s peace from Germany. This
      very Council was formed for the purpose of imposing that peace upon the
      Government. Are you going to back out now, because a dilettante writer, an
      aristocrat who never did a stroke of work in his life, casts sneering
      doubts upon my honesty? I&rsquo;ve done the work you gave me to do. It&rsquo;s up to
      you to finish it, I represent a million working men. So does David Sands
      there, Evans and Cross, and you others. What does Orden represent? Nobody
      and nothing! Miles Furley? A little band of Socialists who live in their
      gardens and keep bees! My lord Bishop? Just his congregation from week to
      week! Yet it&rsquo;s these outsiders who&rsquo;ve come in and disturbed us. I&rsquo;ve had
      enough of it and them. We&rsquo;ve wasted the night, but I propose that the
      telegrams go out at eight o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning. Hands up for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a counter-attack which swept everything before it. Every hand in
      the room except the Bishop&rsquo;s, Furley&rsquo;s, Cross&rsquo;s and Julian&rsquo;s was raised.
      Fenn led the way towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve our work to do, chaps,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave the others to talk
      till daylight, if they want to.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Julian and Furley left the place together. They looked for the Bishop but
      found that he had slipped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Downing Street, I believe,&rdquo; Furley remarked. &ldquo;He has some vague idea
      of suggesting a compromise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compromise!&rdquo; Julian repeated a little drearily. &ldquo;How can there be any
      such thing! There might be delay. I think we ought to have given Stenson a
      week&mdash;time to communicate with America and send a mission to France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are like all theorists,&rdquo; Furley declared moodily, stopping to relight
      his pipe. &ldquo;We create and destroy on palter with amazing facility. When it
      comes to practice, we are funks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you funking this?&rdquo; Julian asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can any one help it? Theoretically we are right&mdash;I am sure of
      it. If we leave it to the politicians, this war will go dragging on for
      God knows how long. It&rsquo;s the people who are paying. It&rsquo;s the people who
      ought to make the peace. The only thing that bothers me is whether we are
      doing it the right way. Is Freistner honest? Could he be self-deceived? Is
      there any chance that he could be playing into the hands of the
      Pan-Germans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fenn is the man who has had most to do with him,&rdquo; Julian remarked. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t trust Fenn a yard, but I believe in Freistner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Furley assented, &ldquo;but is Fenn&rsquo;s report of his promises and the
      strength of his followers entirely honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the part of the whole thing I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; Julian acknowledged.
      &ldquo;Fenn&rsquo;s practically the corner stone of this affair. It was he who met
      Freistner in Amsterdam and started these negotiations, and I&rsquo;m damned if I
      like Fenn, or trust him. Did you see the way he looked at Stenson out of
      the corners of his eyes, like a little ferret? Stenson was at his best,
      too. I never admired the man more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly kept his head,&rdquo; Furley agreed. &ldquo;His few straight words were
      to the point, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the occasion for eloquence,&rdquo; Julian declared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll come
      next week. I suppose he&rsquo;ll try and break the Trades Unions. What a chance
      for an Edmund Burke! It&rsquo;s all right, I suppose, but I wonder why I&rsquo;m
      feeling so damned miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; Furley confided, &ldquo;you and I and the Bishop and Miss Abbeway
      are all to a certain extent out of place on that Council. We ought to have
      contented ourselves with having supplied the ideas. When it comes to the
      practical side, our other instincts revolt. After all, if we believed that
      by continuing the war we could beat Germany from a military point of view,
      I suppose we should forget a lot of this admirable reasoning of ours and
      let it go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem a fair bargain, though,&rdquo; Julian sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the lives
      of our men to-day for the freedom of their descendants, if that isn&rsquo;t
      frittered away by another race of politicians. It isn&rsquo;t good enough,
      Miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s be thankful it&rsquo;s going to stop,&rdquo; Furley declared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
      pinned our colours to the mast, Julian. I don&rsquo;t like Fenn any more than
      you do, nor do I trust him, but I can&rsquo;t see, in this instance, that he has
      anything to gain by not running straight. Besides, he can&rsquo;t have faked the
      terms, and that&rsquo;s the only document that counts. And so good night and to
      bed,&rdquo; he added, pausing at the street corner, where they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something curiously different about the demeanour of Julian&rsquo;s
      trusted servant, as he took his master&rsquo;s coat and hat. Even Julian,
      engrossed as he was in the happenings of the evening, could scarcely fail
      to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem out of sorts to-night, Robert!&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, whose manners were usually suave and excellent, answered
      almost harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have enough to make me so, sir&mdash;more than enough. I wish to give a
      week&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been drinking, Robert?&rdquo; his master enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled mirthlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sober, sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I should be glad to go at once.
      It would be better for both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you against me?&rdquo; Julian asked, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lives of my two boys,&rdquo; was the fierce reply. &ldquo;Fred&rsquo;s gone now&mdash;died
      in hospital last night. It was you who talked them into soldiering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian&rsquo;s manner changed at once, and his tone became kinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very foolish to blame anybody, Robert. Your sons did their duty.
      If they hadn&rsquo;t joined up when they did, they would have had to join as
      conscripts later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their duty!&rdquo; Robert repeated, with smothered scorn. &ldquo;Their duty to a
      squirming nest of cowardly politicians&mdash;begging your pardon, sir.
      Why, the whole Government isn&rsquo;t worth the blood of one of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry about Fred,&rdquo; Julian said sympathetically. &ldquo;All the same,
      Robert, you must try and pull yourself together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull myself together!&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;Mr. Orden, sir, I&rsquo;m trying to
      keep respectful, but it&rsquo;s a hard thing. I&rsquo;ve been reading the evening
      papers. There&rsquo;s an article, signed &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo;, in the Pall Mall. They
      tell me that you&rsquo;re Paul Fiske. You&rsquo;re for peace, it seems&mdash;for peace
      with the German Emperor and his bloody crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in favour of peace on certain terms, at the earliest possible
      moment,&rdquo; Julian admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ve sold us, then&mdash;sold us all!&rdquo; Robert declared
      fiercely. &ldquo;My boys died believing they were fighting for men who would
      keep their word. The war was to go on till victory was won.. They died
      happily, believing that those who had spoken for England would keep their
      word. You&rsquo;re very soft-hearted in that article, sir, about the living. Did
      you think, when you sat down to write it, about the dead?&mdash;about that
      wilderness of white crosses out in France? You&rsquo;re proposing in cold blood
      to let those devils stay on their own dunghill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very large question, Robert,&rdquo; Julian reminded him. &ldquo;The war is
      fast reaching a period of mutual exhaustion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man threw all restraint to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claptrap!&rdquo; was his angry reply. &ldquo;You wealthy people want your fleshpots
      again. We&rsquo;ve a few more million men, haven&rsquo;t we? America has a few more
      millions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own loss, Robert, has made you&mdash;and quite naturally, too&mdash;very
      bitter,&rdquo; his master said gently. &ldquo;You must let those who have thought this
      matter out come to a decision upon it. Beyond a certain point, the manhood
      of the world must be conserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds just like fine talk to me, sir, and no more; the sort of
      stuff that&rsquo;s printed in articles and that no one takes much stock of.
      Words were plain enough when we started out to fight this war. We were
      going to crush the German military spirit and not leave off fighting until
      we&rsquo;d done it. There was nothing said then about conserving millions of
      men. It was to be fought out to the end, whatever it cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were once a pacifist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pacifist!&rdquo; the man repeated passionately. &ldquo;Every human being with common
      sense was a pacifist when the war started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the war was forced upon us,&rdquo; Julian reminded him. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deny
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one wishes to, sir. It was forced upon us all right, but who made it
      necessary? Why, our rotten government for the last twenty years! Our
      politicians, Mr. Julian, that are prating now of peace before their job&rsquo;s
      done! Do you think that if we&rsquo;d paid our insurance like men and been
      prepared, this war would ever have come? Not it! We asked for trouble, and
      we got it in the neck. If we make peace now, we&rsquo;ll be a German colony in
      twenty years, thanks to Mr. Stenson and you and the rest of them. A man
      can be a pacifist all right until his head has been punched. Afterwards,
      there&rsquo;s another name for him. Is there anything more I can get you
      to-night before I leave, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, thanks. I&rsquo;m sorry about Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian, conscious of an intense weariness, undressed and went to bed very
      soon after the man&rsquo;s departure. He was already in his first doze when he
      awoke suddenly with a start. He sat up and listened. The sound which had
      disturbed him was repeated,&mdash;a quiet but insistent ringing of the
      front-door bell. He glanced at his watch. It was barely midnight, but
      unusually late for a visitor. Once more the bell rang, and this time he
      remembered that Robert slept out, and that he was alone in the flat. He
      thrust his feet into slippers, wrapped his dressing gown around him, and
      made his way to the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian&rsquo;s only idea had been that this might be some messenger from the
      Council. To his amazement he found himself confronted by Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close the door,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Come into your sitting room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed past him and he obeyed, still dumb with surprise and the shock
      of his sudden awakening. Catherine herself seemed unaware of his unusual
      costume, reckless of the hour and the strangeness of her visit. She wore a
      long chinchilla coat, covering her from head to foot, and a mantilla veil
      about her head, which partially obscured her features. As soon as she
      raised it, he knew that great things had happened. Her cheeks were the
      colour of ivory, and her eyes unnaturally distended. Her tone was steady
      but full of repressed passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we have been deceived&mdash;tricked! I have come to
      you for help. Are the telegrams sent out yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They go at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God we are in time to stop them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian looked at her for a moment, utterly incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop them?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;But how can we? Stenson has declared war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven for that!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her voice trembling. &ldquo;Julian, the
      whole thing is an accursed plot. The German Socialists have never
      increased their strength except in their own imaginations. They are
      absolutely powerless. This is the most cunning scheme of the whole war.
      Freistner has simply been the tool of the militarists. They encouraged him
      to put forward these proposals and to communicate with Nicholas Fenn. When
      the armistice has been declared and negotiations begun, the three
      signatures will be repudiated. The peace they mean to impose is one of
      their own dictation, and in the meantime we shall have created a cataclysm
      here. The war will never start again. All the Allies will be at a
      discord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How have you found this out?&rdquo; Julian gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From one of Germany&rsquo;s chief friends in England. He is high up in the
      diplomatic service of&mdash;of a neutral country, but he has been working
      for Germany ever since the commencement of the war. He has been helping in
      this. He has seen me often with Nicholas Fenn, and he believes that I am
      behind the scenes, too. He believes that I know the truth, and that I am
      working for Germany. He is absolutely to be relied upon. Every word that I
      am telling you is the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Fenn?&rdquo; Julian demanded breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholas Fenn has had a hundred thousand pounds of German money within
      the last few months,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He is one of the foulest traitors who
      ever breathed. Freistner&rsquo;s first few letters were genuine enough, but for
      the last six weeks he has been imprisoned in a German fortress&mdash;and
      Fenn knows it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any proof of all this?&rdquo; Julian asked. &ldquo;Remember we have the
      Council to face, and they are all girt for battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have proof,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;indirect but damning enough. This man
      has sometimes forwarded and collected for me letters from connections of
      mine in Germany. He handed me one to-night from a distant cousin. You know
      him by name General Geroldberg. The first two pages are personal. Read
      what he says towards the end,&rdquo; she added, passing it on to Julian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian turned up the lamp and read the few lines to which she pointed:
    </p>
    <p>
      By the bye, dear cousin, if you should receive a shock within the next few
      days by hearing that our three great men have agreed to an absurd peace,
      do not worry. Their signatures have been obtained for some document which
      we do not regard seriously, and it is their intention to repudiate them as
      soon as a certain much-looked for event takes place. When the peace comes,
      believe me, it will be a glorious one for us. What we have won by the
      sword we shall hold, and what has been wrested from us by cunning and
      treachery, we shall regain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man,&rdquo; Catherine declared, &ldquo;is one of the Kaiser&rsquo;s intimates. He is
      one of the twelve iron men of Germany. Now I will tell you the name of the
      man with whom I, have spent the evening. It is Baron Hellman. Believe me,
      he knows, and he has told me the truth. He has had this letter by him for
      a fortnight, as he told me frankly that he thought it too compromising to
      hand over. To-night he changed his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian stood speechless for a moment, his fists clenched, his eyes ablaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine threw herself into his easy-chair and loosened her coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am tired!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Give me some water, please, or some wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found some hock in the sideboard, and after she had drunk it they sat
      for some few minutes in agitated silence. The street sounds outside had
      died away. Julian&rsquo;s was the topmost flat in the block, and their isolation
      was complete. He suddenly realised the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he suggested, with an almost ludicrous return to the
      commonplace, &ldquo;the first thing to be done is for me to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him as though she had noticed his dishabille for the first
      time. For a moment their feet seemed to be on the earth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I seem to you crazy to come to you at such an hour,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t think of those things, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;They are unimportant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly the sense of the silence, of their solitude, of their
      strange, uncertain relations to one another, swept in upon them both. For
      a moment the sense of the great burden she was carrying fell from
      Catherine&rsquo;s shoulders. She was back in a simpler world. Julian was no
      longer a leader of the people, the brilliant sociologist, the apostle of
      her creed. He was the man who during the last few weeks had monopolised
      her thoughts to an amazing extent, the man for whose aid and protection
      she had hastened, the man to whom she was perfectly content to entrust the
      setting right of this ghastly blunder. Watching him, she suddenly felt
      that she was tired of it all, that she would like to creep away from the
      storm and rest somewhere. The quiet and his presence seemed to soothe her.
      Her tense expression relaxed, her eyes became softer. She smiled at him
      gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I cannot tell you,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;how glad I am to be with you just
      now! Everything in the outside world seems so terrible. Do you mind&mdash;it
      is so silly, but after all a woman cannot be as strong as a man, can she?&mdash;would
      you mind very much just holding my hand for a moment and staying here
      quite quietly. I have had a horrible evening, and when I came in, my head
      felt as though it would burst. You do not mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian smiled as he leaned towards her. A kind of resentment of which he
      had been conscious, even though in some measure ashamed of it, resentment
      at her unswerving loyalty to the task she had set herself, melted away. He
      suddenly knew why he had kissed her, on that sunny morning on the marshes,
      an ecstatic and incomprehensible moment which had seemed sometimes, during
      these days of excitement, as though it had belonged to another life and
      another world. He took both her hands in his, and, stooping down, kissed
      her on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Catherine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am so glad that you came to me. I think that
      during these last few days we have forgotten to be human, and it might
      help us&mdash;for after all, you know, we are engaged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;was only for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first, perhaps,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but now for mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her little sigh of content, as she stole nearer to him, was purely
      feminine. The moments ticked on in restful and wonderful silence. Then,
      unwillingly, she drew away from his protecting arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you look so nice as you are, and it is such
      happiness to be here, but there is a great task before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he declared, straightening himself. &ldquo;Wait for a few
      minutes, dear. We shall find them all at Westminster&mdash;the place will
      be open all night. Close your eyes and rest while I am away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rested,&rdquo; she answered softly, &ldquo;but do not be long. The car is
      outside, and on the way I have more to tell you about Nicholas Fenn.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the closely drawn blinds of the many windows of Westminster Buildings
      could have been raised that night and early morning, the place would have
      seemed a very hive of industry. Twenty men were hard at work in twenty
      different rooms. Some went about their labours doubtfully, some almost
      timorously, some with jubilation, one or two with real regret. Under their
      fingers grew the more amplified mandates which, following upon the
      bombshell of the already prepared telegrams, were within a few hours to
      paralyse industrial England, to keep her ships idle in the docks, her
      trains motionless upon the rails, her mines silent, her forges cold, her
      great factories empty. Even the least imaginative felt the thrill, the awe
      of the thing he was doing. On paper, in the brain, it seemed so wonderful,
      so logical, so certain of the desired result. And now there were other
      thoughts forcing their way to the front. How would their names live in
      history? How would Englishmen throughout the world regard this deed? Was
      it really the truth they were following, or some false and ruinous shadow?
      These were fugitive doubts, perhaps, but to more than one of those
      midnight toilers they presented themselves in the guise of a chill and
      drear presentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all heard a motor-car stop outside. No one, however, thought it worth
      while to discontinue his labours for long enough to look out and see who
      this nocturnal visitor might be. In a very short time, however, these
      labours were disturbed. From room to room, Julian, with Catherine and the
      Bishop, for whom they had called on the way, passed with a brief message.
      No one made any difficulty about coming to the Council room. The first
      protest was made when they paid the visit which they had purposely left
      until last. Nicholas Fenn had apparently finished or discontinued his
      efforts. He was seated in front of his desk, his chin almost resting upon
      his folded arms, and a cigarette between his lips. Bright was lounging in
      an easy-chair within a few feet of him. Their heads were close together;
      their conversation, whatever the subject of it may have been, was
      conducted in whispers. Apparently they had not heard Julian&rsquo;s knock, for
      they started apart, when the door was opened, like conspirators. There was
      something half-fearful, half-malicious in Fenn&rsquo;s face, as he stared at
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal,&rdquo; he replied curtly. &ldquo;We have been around to every one of
      the delegates and asked them to assemble in the Council room. Will you and
      Bright come at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn looked from one to the other of his visitors and remained silent for
      a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climbing down, eh?&rdquo; he asked viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have some information to communicate,&rdquo; Julian announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fenn moved abruptly away, out of the shadow of the electric lamp which
      hung over his desk. His voice was anxious, unnatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t consider any more information,&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;Our decisions
      have been taken. Nothing can affect them. That&rsquo;s the worst of having you
      outsiders on the board. I was certain you wouldn&rsquo;t face it when the time
      came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you yourself,&rdquo; Julian remarked, &ldquo;are somewhat concerned in this
      matter, I think it would be well if you came with the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to stir from this room,&rdquo; Fenn declared doggedly. &ldquo;I have
      my own work to do. And as to my being concerned with what you have to say,
      I&rsquo;ll thank you to mind your own business and leave mine alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fenn,&rdquo; the Bishop interposed, &ldquo;I beg to offer you my advice that you
      join us at once in the Council room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian and Catherine had already left the room. Fenn leaned forward, and
      there was an altered note in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it mean, Bishop?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely. &ldquo;Are they ratting, those
      two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we have come here to say,&rdquo; the Bishop rejoined, &ldquo;must be said to
      every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away. Fenn and Bright exchanged quick glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; asked Fenn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve changed their minds,&rdquo; Bright muttered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all. They&rsquo;re
      theorists. Damn all theorists! They just blow bubbles to destroy them. As
      for the girl, she&rsquo;s been at parties all the evening, as we know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Fenn acknowledged. &ldquo;I was a fool. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many of the delegates had the air of being glad to escape for a few
      minutes from their tasks. One or two of them entered the room, carrying a
      cup of coffee or cocoa. Most of them were smoking. Fenn and Bright made
      their appearance last of all. The latter made a feeble attempt at a
      good-humoured remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a pause for refreshments?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If so, I&rsquo;m on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian, who had been waiting near the door, locked it. Fenn started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a precaution. We don&rsquo;t want to be interrupted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julian moved towards a little vacant space at the end of the table and
      stood there, his hands upon the back of a chair. The Bishop remained by
      his side, his eyes downcast as though in prayer. Catherine had accepted
      the seat pushed forward by Cross. The atmosphere of the room, which at
      first had been only expectant, became tense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; Julian began, &ldquo;a few hours ago you came to a momentous
      decision. You are all at work, prepared to carry that decision into
      effect. I have come to see you because I am very much afraid that we have
      been the victims of false statements, the victims of a disgraceful plot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Fenn scoffed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ratting, that&rsquo;s what you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better thank Providence,&rdquo; Julian replied sternly, &ldquo;that there is
      time for you to rat, too&mdash;that is, if you have any care for your
      country. Now, Mr. Fenn, I am going to ask you a question. You led us to
      believe, this evening, that, although all letters had been destroyed, you
      were in constant communication with Freistner. When did you hear from him
      last&mdash;personally, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last week,&rdquo; Fenn answered boldly, &ldquo;and the week before that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have destroyed those letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have! Why should I keep stuff about that would hang me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot produce, then, any communication from Freistner, except the
      proposals of peace, written within the last&mdash;say&mdash;month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the mischief are you getting at?&rdquo; Fenn demanded hotly. &ldquo;And what
      right have you to stand there and cross-question me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right of being prepared to call you to your face a liar,&rdquo; Julian said
      gravely. &ldquo;We have very certain information that Freistner is now
      imprisoned in a German fortress and will be shot before the week is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little murmur of consternation, even of disbelief. Fenn
      himself was speechless. Julian went on eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on paper, on the facts submitted to us, we took
      the right decision, but we ought to have remembered this. Germany&rsquo;s word,
      Germany&rsquo;s signature, Germany&rsquo;s honour, are not worth a rap when opposed to
      German interests. Germany, notwithstanding all her successes, is thirsting
      for peace. This armistice would be her salvation. She set herself out to
      get it&mdash;not honestly, as we have been led to believe, but by means of
      a devilish plot. She professed to be overawed by the peace desires of the
      Reichstag. The Pan-Germans professed a desire to give in to the
      Socialists. All lies! They encouraged Freistner to continue his
      negotiations here with Fenn. Freistner was honest enough. I am not so sure
      about Fenn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn sprang to his feet, a blasphemous exclamation broke from his lips.
      Julian faced him, unmoved. The atmosphere of the room was now electric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to finish what I have to say,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I know that every
      one will wish me to. We are all here to look for the truth and nothing
      else, and, thanks to Miss Abbeway, we have stumbled upon it. These peace
      proposals, which look so well on paper, are a decoy. They were made to be
      broken. Those signatures are affixed to be repudiated. I say that
      Freistner has been a prisoner for weeks, and I deny that Fenn has received
      a single communication from him during that time. Fenn asserts that he
      has, but has destroyed them. I repeat that he is a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s plain speaking,&rdquo; Cross declared. &ldquo;Now, then, Fenn, lad, what have
      you to say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn leaned forward, his face distorted with something which might have
      been anger, but which seemed more closely to resemble fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is just part of the ratting!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I never keep a
      communication from Freistner. I have told you so before. The preliminary
      letters I had you all saw, and we deliberated upon them together. Since
      then, all that I have had have been friendly messages, which I have
      destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little uncertain murmur. Julian proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Fenn is not able to clear himself from my first
      accusation. Now let us hear what he will do with this one. Mr. Fenn
      started life, I believe, as a schoolmaster at a parish school, a very
      laudable and excellent occupation. He subsequently became manager to a
      firm of timber merchants in the city and commenced to interest himself in
      Labour movements. He rose by industry and merit to his present position&mdash;a
      very excellent career, but not, I should think, a remunerative one. Shall
      we put his present salary down at ten pounds a week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil concern is this of yours?&rdquo; the goaded man shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of mine and all of us,&rdquo; Julian retorted, &ldquo;for I come now to a certain
      question. Will you disclose your bank book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn reeled for a moment in his seat. He affected not to have heard the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My what?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bank book,&rdquo; Julian repeated calmly. &ldquo;As you only received your last
      instalment from Germany this week, you probably have not yet had time to
      purchase stocks and shares or property wherever your inclination leads
      you. I imagine, therefore, that there would be a balance there of
      something like thirty thousand pounds, the last payment made to you by a
      German agent now in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fenn sprang to his feet. He had all the appearance of a man about to make
      a vigorous and exhaustive defence. And then suddenly he swayed, his face
      became horrible to look upon, his lips were twisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Some one give me brandy! I am ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He collapsed in a heap. They carried him on to a seat set against the
      wall, and Catherine bent over him. He lay there, moaning. They loosened
      his collar and poured restoratives between his teeth. For a time he was
      silent. Then the moaning began again. Julian returned to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;this is as much a tragedy to me as to
      any one present. I believe that every one of you here except&mdash;&rdquo; he
      glanced towards the sofa&mdash;&ldquo;except those whom we will not name have
      gone into this matter honestly, as I did. We&rsquo;ve got to chuck it. Tear up
      your telegrams. Let me go to see Stenson this minute. I see the truth
      about this thing now as I never saw it before. There is no peace for us
      with Germany until she is on her knees, until we have taken away all her
      power to do further mischief. When that time comes let us be generous. Let
      us remember that her working men are of the same flesh and blood as ours
      and need to live as you need to live. Let us see that they are left the
      means to live. Mercy to all of them&mdash;mercy, and all the possibilities
      of a free and generous life. But to Hell with every one of those who are
      responsible for the poison which has crept throughout all ranks in
      Germany, which, starting from the Kaiser and his friends, has corrupted
      first the proud aristocracy, then the industrious, hard-working and worthy
      middle classes, and has even permeated to some extent the ranks of the
      people themselves, destined by their infamous ruler to carry on their
      shoulders the burden of an unnatural, ungodly, and unholy ambition. There
      is much that I ought to say, but I fancy that I have said enough. Germany
      must be broken, and you can do it. Let the memory of those undispatched
      telegrams help you. Spend your time amongst the men you represent. Make
      them see the truth. Make them understand that every burden they lift,
      every time they wield the pickaxe, every blow they strike in their daily
      work, helps. I was going to speak about what we owe to the dead. I won&rsquo;t.
      We must beat Germany to her knees. We can and we will. Then will come the
      time for generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phineas Cross struck the table with the flat of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I feel the sweat in every pore of my body. We&rsquo;ve nigh
      done a horrible thing. We are with you, Mr. Orden. But about that little
      skunk there? How did you find him out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through Miss Abbeway,&rdquo; Julian answered. &ldquo;You have her to thank. I can
      assure you that every charge I have made can be substantiated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little murmur of confidence. Everyone seemed to find speech
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; Julian went on. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disband this Council. Keep it
      together, just as it is. Keep this building. Keep our association and
      sanctify it to one purpose&mdash;victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud clamour of applause answered him. Once more Cross glanced towards
      the prostrate form upon the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let no one interfere,&rdquo; Julian enjoined. &ldquo;There is an Act which will deal
      with him. He will be removed from this place presently, and he will not be
      heard of again for a little time. We don&rsquo;t want a soul to know how nearly
      we were duped. It rests with every one of you to destroy all the traces of
      what might have happened. You can do this if you will. To-morrow call a
      meeting of the Council. Appoint a permanent chairman, a new secretary,
      draw out a syllabus of action for promoting increased production, for
      stimulating throughout every industry a passionate desire for victory. If
      speaking, writing, or help of mine in any way is wanted, it is yours. I
      will willingly be a disciple of the cause. But this morning let me be your
      ambassador. Let me go to the Premier with a message from you. Let me tell
      him what you have resolved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands up all in favour!&rdquo; Cross exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every hand was raised. Bright came back from the couch, blinking
      underneath his heavy spectacles but meekly acquiescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us remember this hour,&rdquo; the Bishop begged, &ldquo;as something solemn in
      our lives. The Council of Labour shall justify itself, shall voice the
      will or the people, fighting for victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the Peace which comes through Victory!&rdquo; Julian echoed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Bishop and Catherine, a few weeks later, walked side by side up the
      murky length of St. Pancras platform. The train which they had come to
      meet was a quarter of an hour late, and they had fallen into a sort of
      reminiscent conversation which was not without interest to both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left Mr. Stenson only an hour ago,&rdquo; the Bishop observed. &ldquo;He could talk
      about nothing but Julian Orden and his wonderful speeches. They say that
      at Sheffield and Newcastle the enthusiasm was tremendous, and at three
      shipbuilding yards on the Clyde the actual work done for the week after
      his visit was nearly as much again. He seems to have that extraordinary
      gift of talking straight to the hearts of the men. He makes them feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stenson wrote me about it,&rdquo; Catherine told her companion, with a
      little smile. &ldquo;He said that no dignity that could be thought of or
      invented would be an adequate offering to Julian for his services to the
      country. For the first time since the war, Labour seems wholly and
      entirely, passionately almost, in earnest. Every one of those delegates
      went back full of enthusiasm, and with every one of them, Julian, before
      he has finished, is going to make a little tour in his own district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after to-morrow,&rdquo; the Bishop remarked with a smile, &ldquo;I suppose he
      will not be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very wonderful to think about,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I am going to
      try and be Julian&rsquo;s secretary&mdash;whilst we are away, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t often,&rdquo; the Bishop reflected, &ldquo;that I have the chance of a few
      minutes&rsquo; quiet conversation, on the day before her wedding, with the woman
      whom I am going to marry to the man I think most of on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me some good advice,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A wife who loves her husband needs very few
      words of admonition. There are marriages so often in which one can see the
      rocks ahead that one opens one&rsquo;s prayer-book, even, with a little tremor
      of fear. But with you and Julian it is different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing that a woman can do for the man whom she loves,&rdquo; she
      declared softly, &ldquo;which I shall not try to do for Julian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They paced up and down for a few moments in silence. The Bishop&rsquo;s step was
      almost buoyant. He seemed to have lost all that weary load of anxiety
      which had weighed him down during the last few months. Catherine, too, in
      her becoming grey furs, her face flushed with excitement, had the air of
      one who has thrown all anxiety to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian&rsquo;s gift of speech must have surprised even himself,&rdquo; the Bishop
      remarked. &ldquo;Of course, we always knew that &lsquo;Paul Fiske&rsquo;, when he was found,
      must be a brilliant person, but I don&rsquo;t think that even Julian himself had
      any suspicion of his oratorical powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he had,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;In his first letter he told me that
      it was just like sitting down at his desk to write, except that all the
      dull material impedimenta of paper and ink and walls seemed rolled away,
      and the men to whom he wished his words to travel were there waiting. Of
      course, he is wonderful, but Phineas Cross, David Sands and some of the
      others have shown a positive genius for organisation. That Council of
      Socialism, Trades Unionism, and Labour generally, which was formed to
      bring us premature peace, seems for the first time to have brought all
      Labour into one party, Labour in its very broadest sense, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth of the matter is,&rdquo; the Bishop pronounced, &ldquo;that the people have
      accepted the dictum that whatever form of republicanism is aimed at, there
      must be government. A body of men who realise that, however advanced their
      ideas, can do but little harm. I am perfectly certain&mdash;Stenson admits
      it himself&mdash;that before very long we shall have a Labour Ministry.
      Who cares? It will probably be a good ministry&mdash;good for the country
      and good for the world. There has been too much juggling in international
      politics. This war is going to end that, once and for ever. By the bye,&rdquo;
       he went on, in an altered tone, &ldquo;there is one question which I have always
      had in my mind to ask you. If I do so now, will you please understand that
      if you think it best you need not answer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Catherine replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what source did you get your information which saved us all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came to me from a man who is dead,&rdquo; was the quiet answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop looked steadily ahead at the row of signal lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a young foreigner, some weeks ago,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;a Baron Hellman&mdash;quite
      a distinguished person, I believe&mdash;who was discovered shot in his
      rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She acquiesced silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to go to the Home Office and were able to persuade them to
      treat you candidly, I think that you could discover some wonderful
      things,&rdquo; she confided. &ldquo;I wish I could believe that the Baron was the only
      one who has been living in this country, unsuspected, and occupying a
      prominent position, who was really in the pay of Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very subtle conspiracy,&rdquo; the Bishop remarked thoughtfully,
      &ldquo;subtle because, in a sense, it appeared so genuine. It appealed to the
      very best instincts of thinking men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good has come out of it, at any rate,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;Westminster
      Buildings is now the centre of patriotic England. Labour was to have
      brought the war to an end&mdash;for Germany. It is Labour which is going
      to win the victory&mdash;for England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train rolled into the station and rapidly disgorged its crowd of
      passengers, amongst whom Julian was one of the first to alight. Catherine
      found herself trembling. The shy words of welcome which had formed
      themselves in her mind died away on her lips as their glances met. She
      lifted her face to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I am so proud&mdash;so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop left them as they stepped into their cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to a mission room in the neighbourhood,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We
      have war talks every week. I try to tell them how things are going on, and
      we have a short service. But before I go, Mr. Stenson has sent you a
      little message, Julian. If you go to your club later on to-night, you will
      see it in the telegrams, or you will find it in your newspapers in the
      morning. There has been wonderful fighting in Flanders to-day. The German
      line has been broken at half a dozen points. We have taken nearly twenty
      thousand prisoners, and Zeebrugge is threatened. Farther south, the
      Americans have made their start and have won a complete victory over the
      Crown Prince&rsquo;s picked troops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men wrung hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; Julian declared, &ldquo;is the only way to Peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
